    "essay": "Will White and I examined how predator density affects functional responses in coral reef fish. The functional response—the mathematical relationship between prey density and predation rate—is fundamental to understanding predator-prey dynamics. Most theoretical work develops from studies of single predators, but real reef communities contain multiple predators hunting simultaneously.\n\nWe investigated how predator density modifies these relationships. When predator densities change, per-capita predation rates don't remain constant. Multiple predators interact in ways that affect hunting efficiency—whether through interference, facilitation, or competition for prey.\n\nThe implications extend to how we model and predict reef fish dynamics. Standard approaches that assume constant per-capita predation rates may miss important density-dependent effects. As marine protected areas increase predator abundances and fishing reduces them elsewhere, understanding how predator density affects predation becomes practically important.\n\nThe work connects individual-level behavior to population-level dynamics. How predators interact with each other while hunting affects prey populations in ways that simple models don't capture. Incorporating these density-dependent functional responses into reef ecosystem models should improve predictions about how fish communities respond to changes in predator abundance."
