- Temperature plays a key role in driving the geographic range of spiny lobsters and that spatial and temporal shifts in temperature can play a critical role in driving the strength of species interactions for a key predator in temperate reef ecosystems.
- Metabolic, and predation rates increase as functions of temperature, but show that predation rates increased at a faster rate with temperature than metabolism.

Anticipating how reductions in body size will alter species interactions is critical to managing marine systems in an ecosystem context.

### Key Findings

- Our results reveal that predator and prey body size has the greatest effect on interaction strength when prey abundance is high.
- Dead coral skeletons could substantially diminish coral resilience if they provided macroalgae refuge from herbivory, a key feedback associated with the recovery of coral populations.
- Better integration of material legacies into studies of resilience may offer key insight into when and where ecosystems that are dominated by structure-forming organisms will cross tipping points.


### The Bigger Picture

Spiny lobsters play a key role in coastal ecosystems as both predators and prey. They also support valuable commercial and recreational fisheries along the Pacific coast.

    content: `In coastal California, scientists have found that we found no evidence that the proportion of biomass lost as fronds and blades varied with standing kelp biomass or temperature (Appendix S2: we found that—like urchin biomass—historical kelp consumption is likely to have varied considerably.

Rennick and colleagues used pcoa in coastal California to investigate the question.

To test this hypothesis, we quantified how the foraging habits of an important group of marine herbivores—sea urchins—change with increases in sea urchin biomass and trigger regime shifts to a foundation species, giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera).

### Key Findings

- We found no evidence that the proportion of biomass lost as fronds and blades varied with standing kelp biomass or temperature (Appendix S2: we found that—like urchin biomass—historical kelp consumption is likely to have varied considerably.
- We found no evidence for a nonlinear relationship between urchin biomass and consumptive capacity.
- We found that, for both purple and red urchins, consumption of kelp blades increased linearly with consumer biomass, suggesting that, even at high consumer biomass, grazing rates do not decelerate due to competition or accelerate due to facilitation.
- We observed numerous instances in which kelp biomass remained high, despite the presence of dense urchin populations.


### The Bigger Picture

Kelp forests are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth, providing habitat for countless species and protecting coastlines from erosion. As ocean conditions shift, understanding what maintains these underwater forests becomes increasingly urgent.

Our study emphasizes the combined effects of local and global human impacts in driving significant ecosystem shifts and suggests that adaptation is likely the central avenue forward for maintaining services in the face of global climate change.

### Key Findings

- We show the interactive effects of global warming and changes infishing pressure in driving the most recent regime and document the existence of hysteresis we found only 5 of the 55 papers reviewed mentioning the concepts of hysteresis and irreversibility.
- We showed for thefirst time that the North Sea underwent a true, irreversible regime shift and that the community completely restructured after 2003.

### Key Findings

- Surprisingly, we found no relationship between human influence and resistance to disturbance and some evidence that areas with greater human development may recover from disturbance faster than their more isolated counterparts.
- Our results suggest remote coral reefs are imperiled by climate change, like so many other geographically isolated ecosystems, and are unlikely to serve as effective biodiversity arks.
- Precautionary buffers that trigger increased monitoring precision as resource levels decline may offer a way to minimize monitoring costs and maximize profits.
- Our results suggest higher monitoring precision always leads to higher economic value than low-precision monitoring .

    content: `Our analyses show significant differences in intraspecific feeding rates, time spent grazing, and intensity of grazing across sites, which may alter the ecological impact of a given scarid population.

As managers set targets to enhance herbivory on reefs, it is critical that we understand potential differences in scarid grazing impact.

### Key Findings

- Our analyses show significant differences in intraspecific feeding rates, time spent grazing, and intensity of grazing across sites, which may alter the ecological impact of a given scarid population.
- We observed grazing behavior of two dominant scarid species, Sparisoma viride and Scarus vetula, at each of our 13 study sites.

### Key Findings

- Disturbance and foundation species can both have strong impacts on ecosystem structure and function, but studies of their interacting effects are hindered by the long life spans and slow growth of most foundation species.
- The percent cover of understory macroalgae was significantly higher in severe years than mild years (t=−12.
- Temporal variability in the abundance of a foundation species may influence diversity in a similar way: when foundation species are volatile, the resulting environmental heterogeneity can promote the coexistence of species with different resource requirements.

### Key Findings

- We found greater build-up of lobsters within MPAs relative to unprotected areas, and greater increases in fishing effort and total lobster catch, but not CPUE, in fishing zones containing MPAs vs.
- A 35% reduction in fishing area resulting from MPA designation was compensated for by a 225% increase in total catch after 6-years, thus indicating at a local scale that the trade-off of fishing ground for no-fishing zones benefitted the fishery.
- By responding to the no-fishing zones by fishing near MPA borders, the fishery is experiencing a net benefit of no-fishing zones at a local scale.


### The Bigger Picture

Spiny lobsters play a key role in coastal ecosystems as both predators and prey. They also support valuable commercial and recreational fisheries along the Pacific coast.

    content: `A growing body of literature has documented myriad effects of human activities on animal behaviour, yet the ultimate ecological consequences of these behavioural shifts remain largely uninvestigated. While it is understood that, in the absence of humans, variation in animal behaviour can have cascading effects on species interactions, community structure and ecosystem function, we know little about whether the type or magnitude of human‐induced behavioural shifts translate into detectable ecological change. Here we synthesise empirical literature and theory to create a novel framework for examining the range of behaviourally mediated pathways through which human activities may affect different ecosystem functions.

This is potentially of great interest, because predation by recovering lobster populations could alter the stability of kelp forests by culling specific phenotypes, like foraging phenotypes, from urchin populations.

### Key Findings

- Taken together, these results suggest that purple urchin activity level and size jointly determine their susceptibility to predation by lobsters.
- Slow‐ moving urchins were more likely to survive encounters with lobsters , whereas covering behavior did not predict urchin survival on its own.
- Fast‐moving purple urchins were more likely to succumb to lobsters than sedentary urchins.
- Urchin behavior may potentially play a role in driving the dynamics of kelp forest ecosystems at fine spatial scales.

- Our findings suggest two different pathways (i.e., habitat or predator shifts) by which natural and/or anthropogenic processes can drive variation in fish biodiversity and community assembly.
- Our findings suggest two different pathways we observed no evidence of aggressive coloration, or any cooperative or antagonistic interactions in treatments where two groupers were present in the same cage; however, we do not know precisely whether groupers changed their foraging behavior in the presence of a second conspecific.
- We observed increases in species richness (strongest in the absence of groupers) and substantial changes in species composition for fragmented patches relative to whole reefs.

- The multiplicative (log-link) model fitted the data worse than an analogous model using the standard logit link, because the logit-link model was better able to handle block–treatment combinations with high expected predation rates.
- We observed differences in the efficacy of defense provided by two coral mutualists.

### Key Findings

- Repeated applications of concentrations of clove oil≥14% can, on average, reduce growth by 3040%, and increase bleaching by 20-80%, relative to controls.
- The repeated use of clove oil to remove organisms could confound results, if the experiment does not include a proper Fig.
- These results suggest the repeated use of clove oil (even without a solvent) can deleteriously affect corals.


### The Bigger Picture

Coral reefs support roughly a quarter of all marine species while covering less than 1% of the ocean floor. Understanding the ecological processes that maintain these ecosystems is crucial as they face unprecedented threats from climate change and human activities.

    content: `The strength of competition depends not only on the identity of competitors, but also on the sequence and timing of their interactions, suggesting that when examining interaction strengths, it is important to identify temporal variability in the direction and magnitude of their effects.

This study shows that the strength of competition depends not only on the identity of competitors, but also on the sequence and timing of their interactions, suggesting that when examining interaction strengths, it is important to identify temporal variability in the direction and magnitude of their effects.

### Key Findings

- The strength of competition depends not only on the identity of competitors, but also on the sequence and timing of their interactions, suggesting that when examining interaction strengths, it is important to identify temporal variability in the direction and magnitude of their effects.
- We found no immigrants or emigrants, and previous research has shown that small reef fish rarely move between reefs separated by as little as 15 m (Caselle 1999, Shima 2001).
- Variability in the timing of settlement pulses ofT.
- The strength of competitive effects was primarily related to relative arrival time and poorly explained by the identity of prior residents.
