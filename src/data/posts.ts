    content: `Tory Chase, Craig Osenberg, and I set out to answer a question that has been building in our field for years: what exactly do fish do for corals? The textbook view treats fish as tenants exploiting coral shelter. But scattered across the literature were hints that fish were paying something back. We wanted to pull those threads together.

We reviewed decades of studies on coral-fish interactions, looking for evidence of specific services that fish provide to their hosts. We focused on coral-associated fishes—species that maintain close spatial relationships with live coral, from obligate dwellers like damselfishes to opportunistic sheltering species like grunts and snappers.

The evidence for fish services turned out to be substantial. Damselfishes hovering in a sleep-like state at night maintain water flow across coral branches, preventing the dangerous hypoxia that can develop when photosynthesis stops. One study found that Dascyllus marginatus increased coral photosynthesis by 3-6% through this ventilation effect. Nutrient delivery was even more dramatic: grunt schools in the Caribbean increase nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations around corals by tenfold, leading to 75% increases in growth of Acropora cervicornis. In sedimented environments, corals without fish accumulated 2-5 times more sediment than corals with fish, resulting in up to 90% reduction in coral survival.

Not all the findings were straightforward. Fish effects can flip from positive to negative depending on context. At very high fish densities or in high-nutrient environments, the nitrogen fish provide may become toxic rather than beneficial. Surveys in the Florida Keys found patterns opposite to controlled experiments—lower herbivory and higher macroalgae in areas with more fish excretion. Whether this represents alternate stable states or scale-dependent dynamics remains unclear.

What strikes us most is how these services might interact with climate stress. Marine heatwaves cause coral bleaching, but the mechanisms fish use to benefit corals—nutrient delivery, enhanced oxygenation, sediment removal—could theoretically help corals resist or recover from thermal stress. The evidence is limited: only two studies have examined fish effects during heat stress, and they show mixed results. This is where the field needs to go.

Much remains unknown. We don't fully understand how fish services scale from individual colonies to reef-wide effects. We don't know which fish species provide the most benefit, or how overfishing alters these dynamics. Coral restoration projects rarely account for fish partnerships. If fish are indeed paying rent that helps corals survive, then protecting reef fish populations isn't just about fish—it may be essential for coral survival itself.

    content: `Craig Osenberg and I wrote this guide to introduce readers to one of the ocean's more remarkable partnerships: the relationship between Trapeziid crabs and the corals they call home. Over 20 species of these small crustaceans live exclusively within branching corals in the tropical Pacific, and they can't survive anywhere else.

The crabs earn their keep. Crown-of-thorns sea stars and pincushion stars are voracious coral predators that can devastate reefs. A single sea star could eat an entire coral colony in one night. But Trapeziid crabs fight back—they use their powerful claws to shove the sea star and pinch its tube feet, deterring predators many times their size. The comparison to ants protecting Acacia trees from elephants and other large herbivores isn't far off.

Defense against predators is just one service. Sediment settling on coral surfaces can kill corals by reducing light availability, heterotrophic feeding, and oxygen availability. When researchers remove crabs from corals in coastal areas with high sedimentation rates, the corals die. When crabs are present, corals survive. The crabs aren't just guards—they're housekeepers.

The relationship has costs for the coral. Crabs eat coral tissue, mucus, and lipid bodies, which they obtain by agitating and scraping the coral with their claws. But their feeding behavior primarily targets damaged or dying tissue rather than healthy portions. Some studies suggest their feeding may even benefit corals by removing potential sites for infection or disease. The benefits of protection typically far outweigh the cost of feeding.

Climate change threatens this partnership. In experiments simulating future ocean conditions, increased water temperature reduced crab abundance and egg production. Heat-stressed crabs expelled their mates and other crustaceans that also help defend corals. The crabs are intimately linked to coral success, and anything that threatens corals ultimately threatens the crabs.

The potential for feedback loops is concerning. Coral decline reduces crab populations. Fewer crabs mean less protection from predators and sediment. Unprotected corals decline faster. The mutual dependence that made this partnership successful could become a vulnerability as reefs face mounting stress from warming and acidification.

    content: `Craig Osenberg and I wrote this essay to highlight an overlooked factor in coral resilience: the fish and invertebrates that live intimately associated with corals. Most research on coral bleaching has ignored these organisms, focusing instead on the coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis. But recent studies are changing that view.

The evidence is striking. In Australian and Polynesian waters, corals living with small planktivorous damselfishes are less likely to bleach and can maintain positive growth rates during and after simulated heatwaves. Corals without fish present underwent bleaching and had poorer physiological performance. The mechanism appears to involve nutrients—fish excrete ammonia-rich waste, which is easier for zooxanthellae to process than the nitrate typically available in seawater. This allows corals to sustain their zooxanthellae despite increased temperatures.

Another study found that corals living within territories of farmerfish during a heatwave were a third less likely to die and twice as likely to recover. The authors hypothesize that when farmerfish protect corals from predators, corals don't need to retract their polyps as often. This lets them feed more on zooplankton, supplementing the nutrition lost when the coral-algae symbiosis breaks down during heat stress.

Invertebrates matter too. Guard crabs and snapping shrimp eat coral mucus and in exchange remove harmful sediments and protect the coral from predatory sea stars. Under experimentally acidified conditions, corals with these crustaceans incurred no net cost of hosting them—acidification changed the relationship from parasitic to commensal. However, under extreme heating, the cooperative relationship between crabs and shrimp can flip to an antagonistic one, with the largest male crabs fighting, killing, and expelling other crustaceans.

One number captures why this matters for conservation: a single cauliflower coral colony at 0.01 m³ can house more than 65 crustaceans and fishes from more than 20 species. We know almost nothing about the natural history of most of these species, let alone their link to coral resilience. Sea cucumbers reduce coral disease by eating bacteria in detritus. Spider crabs increase young coral survival by 85% by reducing macroalgae. The diversity of potential beneficial interactions is enormous.

The implications are sobering. Coral-associated animals are not a solution to the problems wrought by climate change—under extreme stress, beneficial relationships can break down entirely. But understanding these partnerships may help explain why some corals survive when others don't, and why restoration efforts that ignore the associated community may be missing something important.

    content: `Samantha Csik, Bartholomew DiFiore, Krista Kraskura, Emily Hardison, Joe Curtis, Erika Eliason, and I wanted to understand something fundamental: when temperatures rise, can predators eat fast enough to keep up with their rising energy costs? Theory predicts that increases in temperature drive increases in metabolism, and that animals must ramp up consumption to meet that demand. But if consumption doesn't increase as fast as metabolism, animals face a calorie deficit that could ultimately reduce their fitness.

We tested this using California spiny lobsters, acclimating individuals to temperatures they experience across their geographic range—11, 16, 21, and 26°C. Then we measured both how fast they burned energy using respirometry and how quickly they consumed mussel prey. The relationship between those two numbers tells you whether a lobster is running a surplus or a deficit.

Contrary to our hypothesis, consumption rates increased faster than metabolic rates as temperatures rose. Within the mid-range of temperatures, lobsters could more than meet their caloric demands. This suggests that some species may not immediately suffer from a bioenergetic meltdown as temperatures climb. But the extremes told a different story. At 11°C, lobsters barely ate—they had almost no metabolic activity. And at 26°C, 33% of the lobsters died.

The mechanism wasn't about finding prey faster. Temperature had very limited effect on attack rate—how long it took lobsters to search for and initiate feeding on mussels. Instead, temperature dramatically affected handling time—how long it took lobsters to manipulate, consume, and digest their prey. Warmer lobsters processed food faster, allowing them to eat more per unit time.

What stands out is the thermal limits. Maximum metabolic rate was the strongest predictor of consumption rates, suggesting that an animal's capacity for aerobic activity—not just resting metabolism—drives how much it can eat. But that capacity has boundaries. Push past them, and the lobster doesn't just slow down. It dies.

The implications extend beyond lobsters. Spiny lobsters occupy a thermally heterogeneous environment, with temperatures ranging from about 9 to 30°C across their range and seasonal fluctuations as large as 11.5°C in the Santa Barbara Channel. As spatial and temporal shifts in temperature occur, the strength of predator-prey interactions will shift with them—sometimes strengthening where warming favors lobster metabolism, sometimes collapsing entirely where temperatures exceed tolerance.

    content: `Joe Curtis, Journ Galvan, Alexander Primo, Craig Osenberg, and I wanted to know whether emerging 3D technology could actually improve how we measure corals. Photogrammetry is increasingly used on reefs, but most comparisons focus on whether the technology is accurate—not whether it produces better ecological insights than traditional methods.

We measured 60 Pocillopora colonies in Moorea using both approaches. For manual measurements, we used a flexible tape to estimate length, width, and height, then calculated volume as a hemi-ellipsoid—the standard approach for relating coral volume to biodiversity. For photogrammetry, we created 3D models from underwater photographs and measured skeletal volume directly.

The differences mattered. Using photogrammetry, we could measure patterns in changes in coral volume over 105 days that were otherwise obscured by high variation from manual measurements. The noise in manual data washed out the signal; the 3D models captured it. For studies trying to detect coral growth responses to treatments or environmental conditions, this difference in precision could determine whether patterns are detected at all.

The biodiversity predictions were even more striking. We asked which measurement approach best predicted the abundance and richness of coral-associated fish and invertebrates—the animals living within coral branches. Photogrammetry-based estimates of colony skeletal volume outperformed manual approaches. The 3D models captured something about coral architecture that correlates with habitat provisioning.

The practical question is whether the extra effort of photogrammetry is worth it. Equipment and processing time add costs. But for questions about coral growth or the relationship between coral structure and biodiversity, manual measurements may simply be too noisy or too coarse to detect the patterns that matter.

What we can say from this study is specific: for Pocillopora colonies in Moorea, photogrammetry improved our ability to measure growth and predict biodiversity compared to traditional methods. Whether that improvement justifies the cost depends on the research question.

    content: `Bart DiFiore and I wanted to test whether general patterns from the ecological literature could predict how strongly specific species interact. Across taxa, interaction strength tends to increase with predator size. If those general relationships held, we could predict lobster-urchin dynamics without extensive experimentation. But general patterns have considerable noise, and we suspected the deviations might be large.

We ran feeding experiments with California spiny lobsters foraging on purple sea urchins, varying both predator and prey sizes. Then we used 9 years of field data from 5 sites along the California coast to estimate how natural variation in lobster and urchin size distributions translated into variation in interaction strength.

The role of body size was striking. Due to consistently high urchin densities in the field, body size—rather than prey density—accounted for up to 87% of the spatio-temporal variation in interaction strength. When urchins are abundant (which they usually are), the size of lobsters becomes the dominant factor determining predation pressure. Communities with larger lobsters and smaller urchins have stronger interactions; communities with smaller lobsters and larger urchins have weaker ones.

The general relationships failed. Even the best prediction from the literature was, on average, an order of magnitude different from our experimental estimates—+18.7× different. The relationship between body size and interaction strength for lobsters and urchins differs substantially from the mean trend across species. For specific species pairs of management concern, general scaling relationships may not provide useful predictions.

The implications extend to fisheries and conservation. Harvest and climate change are both driving reductions in the average body size of marine species. In marine protected areas where lobsters are protected from fishing, lobster size and density are greater than in fished areas. Our results suggest this could translate into substantially greater predation pressure on urchins. But outside protected areas, size-selective fishing removes the largest lobsters—precisely the individuals exerting the strongest predation pressure.

The contested hypothesis that lobsters control urchin populations may depend on context we've been ignoring. Some research finds evidence for predator-induced declines in urchins; other research finds no evidence at all. Our results suggest the answer depends on size structure: when lobsters are large, lobster density is high, and urchins are small, lobsters could substantially impact urchin populations. Change any of those conditions, and the predation pressure weakens.

    content: `Kai Kopecky, Russ Schmitt, Sally Holbrook, Holly Moeller, and I built a model to explore a counterintuitive question: could the skeletons of dead corals actually make reef recovery harder? Standing dead structures of habitat-forming organisms—what ecologists call material legacies—can affect ecosystem recovery in complex ways. In forests, dead trees affect establishment success of colonizers. On oyster reefs, shells provide substrate for new larvae. On coral reefs, the answer seemed less clear.

Competing hypotheses exist. Dead coral structures might promote faster recovery if they provide habitat for coral-associated organisms that benefit coral growth, or if they offer settlement substrate with refuge spaces for colonizing corals. Alternatively, dead skeletons might diminish resilience if they facilitate the establishment of macroalgae—major competitors of coral—by creating physical refugia from herbivores.

We focused on the herbivory feedback, which is considered crucial for coral recovery. Flat reef surfaces are readily grazed by herbivorous fish and sea urchins, preventing macroalgae establishment and maintaining conditions suitable for coral settlement. But if dead coral skeletons provide refuge where macroalgae can establish protected from grazing, the feedback weakens.

The model showed that material legacies could substantially diminish coral resilience under these conditions. Specifically, dead skeletons broadened the range of herbivore biomass over which coral and macroalgae states were bistable—meaning the same level of herbivory that would allow coral recovery on a cleared reef might instead allow macroalgae establishment on a reef with standing dead structure.

The implications extend to how we think about different types of disturbance. Structure-removing disturbances like intense storms seem more destructive, but they leave clean substrate where herbivores can effectively prevent macroalgae. Structure-retaining disturbances like bleaching kill coral tissue but leave skeletons that may shelter competitors. The reef that looks less damaged might actually be more likely to shift to a degraded state.

The model offers a mechanism for the tremendous variability in coral resilience observed across reef ecosystems. Some reefs recover rapidly; others decline or shift to macroalgae. The presence and type of material legacies—not just the severity of coral mortality—may account for some of that variability.

    tags: ["Research","Coral","Mutualisms","Predation","2023"],
    content: `Holly Moeller, Roger Nisbet, and I built a model to explore how predation fits into multispecies mutualisms. The common prediction in the literature is that predators reduce mutualist abundance and, as a consequence, decrease service provision to the host. But mutualisms involve multiple species of potentially variable quality—and not all mutualists are equally impacted by predation.

Our model was inspired by coral-dwelling fish that increase coral growth by excreting nitrogen-rich waste into the nutrient-poor tropical waters. Multiple fish species compete for space within coral branches, and they don't all provide equivalent services. What happens when a predator enters this system?

The standard expectation would be simple: predator eats mutualists, fewer mutualists remain, coral gets less service. But we found conditions where the opposite occurred. When predators preferentially consumed competitively dominant mutualists that happened to provide lower quality services, predation reversed the outcome of competition. The subordinate competitor—the higher quality mutualist—could then dominate the coral colony. Net result: predation improved coral performance.

The key was asymmetry. If the competitively dominant mutualist was also the better service provider, predation hurt the coral as expected. But if competitive ability and service quality were negatively correlated—if the species that won competitions was worse at helping corals—then predation shuffled the community toward better outcomes.

The direction and strength of predator effects depended on the specific relationships between competition, service provision, and predation vulnerability. There was no universal answer. Predators might benefit corals, harm corals, or have minimal effects depending on the parameter regime.

The findings matter for how we think about reef conservation. When predation strength shifts—due to fishing pressure, species introductions, or climate-driven range shifts—mutualist communities will respond dynamically. The effects on coral hosts will be nonmonotonic, meaning that changes in predator abundance can shift systems through beneficial and detrimental states rather than following simple dose-response relationships.

    content: `Tim Essington, Jameal Samhouri, Margaret Siple, Ben Halpern, Crow White, John Lynham, Anne Salomon, Phil Levin, and I asked a fundamental question for natural resource management: how much monitoring is needed to maximize ecosystem benefits to people while minimizing the risk of species or ecosystem collapse?

The status of a species or ecosystem is determined from monitoring data, assessed relative to minimum thresholds below which the risk of collapse surpasses management tolerance. For example, fisheries management strategies include lower population limits below which harvest is suspended—limit reference points. Managers set these thresholds to allow sustainable harvest while minimizing chances of crossing biological thresholds below which irreversible harm can occur.

One critical biological threshold is depensation—the biomass at which populations become so depleted that their population growth rates become negative. When populations cross this threshold, they can experience inbreeding depression, predator pits, or mate limitation, potentially leading to extinction. High-precision monitoring can lower the risk of crossing such thresholds, but monitoring is also expensive.

We evaluated how the value of monitoring information increases as a natural resource spends more time near critical thresholds. The benefit emerges because higher monitoring precision promotes higher yield and a greater capacity to recover from overharvest. When populations are far from thresholds, coarse monitoring may suffice. As they approach danger, the value of precise information increases dramatically.

This suggests a practical strategy: precautionary buffers that trigger increased monitoring precision as resource levels decline. Rather than maintaining constant monitoring intensity regardless of population status, adaptive monitoring could minimize costs during times of abundance while ramping up precision when populations approach thresholds. This approach balances the expense of monitoring against the risks of mismanagement.

In a world of finite resources for monitoring and management, understanding these trade-offs matters. Stakeholders shoulder the economic and social costs of mismanagement—collapsed fisheries, failed businesses, lost livelihoods. Investing monitoring resources where they provide the most value—near critical thresholds—may help avoid the irreversible harms that occur when populations cross tipping points.

    content: `Camilla Sguotti, Alexandra Blöcker, Leonie Färber, Benjamin Blanz, Roland Cormier, Rabea Diekmann, Jonas Letschert, Henrike Rambo, Nicole Stollberg, Vanessa Stelzenmüller, Christian Möllmann, and I asked whether regime shifts in the North Sea—one of the world's most heavily impacted and best-studied marine ecosystems—are reversible.

In the face of global change, ecosystem resilience is necessary to maintain the critical services ocean ecosystems provide. Yet we still know relatively little about how much anthropogenic pressure an ecosystem can take before it is irrevocably changed. When regime shifts occur, previously abundant commercially harvested species can be replaced by more tolerant species. These changes can be socially and economically costly.

We reviewed the evidence for regime shifts in the North Sea ecosystem, then used catastrophe theory to test whether the shifts display characteristics of irreversibility. Catastrophe theory provides a mathematical framework for detecting tipping points and characterizing whether systems can return to previous states or have settled into new stable configurations.

Our analysis showed that fishing and warming have caused a previously undetected and potentially irreversible regime shift. The combined effects of local human impacts (fishing) and global impacts (climate change) drove significant ecosystem reorganization. The shifts displayed hysteresis—the delayed return to previous conditions—suggesting that reducing fishing pressure may not be sufficient to restore the previous ecosystem state.

The implications for management are significant. While avoiding irreversible regime shifts is fundamental for maintaining ecosystem services, the management application is not straightforward. If restoration isn't possible because thresholds have been crossed, adaptation becomes the central avenue forward. Rather than expecting the ecosystem to bounce back to historical conditions, management must focus on sustaining services in the new configuration.

The consideration of abrupt non-linear change in management is often undermined by the assumption that reducing pressures will lead to recovery. Our findings suggest that for some marine ecosystems, this assumption may be wrong. The North Sea may never return to its 20th-century state. Effective management requires acknowledging this reality and adapting to the ecosystem we have rather than the one we remember.

    content: `Jameal Samhouri, Andrew Shelton, Gregory Williams, Blake Feist, Shannon Hennessey, Krista Bartz, Ryan Kelly, James O'Donnell, Mindi Sheer, Phil Levin, and I asked how terrestrial urbanization affects ecosystems where land meets sea. More than half of the world's human population lives in coastal urban areas. As cities expand, we need to understand how development alters ecosystem structure and function in freshwater and downstream coastal marine habitats.

We investigated associations between landscape-scale urbanization and biodiversity (density and evenness of epibenthic invertebrate families) and ecosystem function (benthic net primary productivity and decomposition) across six pairs of more and less urbanized coastal watersheds in Puget Sound. A general expectation in the field has been that impacts of terrestrial urbanization would attenuate from land to freshwater to coastal marine habitats.

The freshwater results were expected: greater upland urbanization was associated with greater reductions in freshwater biodiversity. But the coastal marine results were surprising. Contrary to our expectations, coastal marine biodiversity tended to be higher at more urbanized sites. This suggests a potential role for low to moderate levels of urbanization-related disturbance in determining coastal marine biodiversity patterns—perhaps through the intermediate disturbance hypothesis or nutrient subsidies.

We found no statistical association between urbanization and our measures of ecosystem function—neither benthic net primary productivity nor decomposition showed clear patterns with urbanization. Additionally, there was no evidence that changes in ecosystem structure with urbanization were more severe in freshwater than coastal marine habitats, as might be expected if the land-sea boundary diminished effects of landscape-scale urbanization.

The results suggest that the effects of urbanization can be complex and that we should not assume impacts will simply decline as one moves from land to freshwater to marine environments. For species like Pacific salmon that rely on freshwater and coastal marine habitats at multiple points in their life cycles, urbanization creates a spatially heterogeneous landscape of impacts.

The findings argue for attention to terrestrial, freshwater, and coastal marine systems in concert, rather than managing them separately. Effective ecosystem-based management requires understanding these connections and the sometimes counterintuitive ways that urban development shapes adjacent ecosystems.

    content: `Mae Rennick, Bart DiFiore, Joe Curtis, Dan Reed, and I tested the hypothesis that herbivore-driven regime shifts occur when consumption exceeds production. We focused on California kelp forests, where sea urchins can transform productive underwater forests into barren, low-productivity states.

The leading hypothesis in the field is that urchins passively forage on kelp detritus—dead scraps that drift down from the canopy—until changes in kelp production cause them to actively graze standing kelp attached to the substrate. We tested this by combining laboratory experiments with 21 years of monitoring data from the Santa Barbara Coastal Long-Term Ecological Research program.

We first quantified how urchin grazing rates varied with urchin biomass in mesocosm experiments. Then we coupled these experimental results with spatially explicit field data to hindcast rates of detrital production and consumption. Finally, we tested whether the relationship between detrital supply and predicted urchin consumption altered the dynamics of standing kelp biomass.

The results confirmed the hypothesis. When grazing capacity exceeded kelp production, sea urchins caused a 50-fold reduction in giant kelp biomass. The balance between detrital supply and urchin foraging mediated alternative states on these temperate rocky reefs.

Kelp forests can maintain high urchin densities without collapsing, as long as detrital production is sufficient to satisfy urchin appetite. But when detrital supply drops—due to storms, warm water events, or any factor reducing kelp production—urchins switch from passive detrital feeding to active grazing on living kelp. That behavioral shift can trigger rapid deforestation.

The findings provide mechanistic understanding of how density-dependent foraging and primary production interact to cause consumer-driven disturbances. Resolving this context dependency is critical for understanding ecosystem tipping points and avoiding biological thresholds that lead to alternative states providing fewer services.

For kelp forest management, the implications are that maintaining kelp canopy—and thus detrital supply—may be as important as controlling urchin abundance. Any disturbance that reduces kelp production shifts the balance toward grazing capacity exceeding supply, increasing the risk of regime shift.

    content: `Hunter Lenihan, Sean Fitzgerald, Dan Reed, Jennifer Hofmeister, and I studied whether spillover from marine reserves increases over time as populations build up inside protected areas. The Northern Channel Islands reserve network was established in 2003, removing about 20% of local spiny lobster fishing grounds. A collaborative fisheries research program in 2008 detected substantial lobster population increases within reserves and an indication of possible adult spillover. We repeated the sampling 10 years later to assess how much things had changed.

The results were striking. Legal-sized lobster abundance in traps increased by 125-465% deep inside reserves over the decade. Abundance also increased by 223-331% at sites near reserve borders, and by nearly 400% just outside of reserve borders. The pattern along the spatial gradient—from inside reserves to outside fishing grounds—indicated substantial increase in spillover across reserve borders.

Spillover from marine reserves is theoretically expected but empirically contested. Short-term costs to fishers from losing fishing grounds are clear and immediate. Benefits from spillover of larvae, juveniles, and adults take time to develop. Early assessments of young reserves often fail to detect spillover, fueling skepticism about whether reserves actually benefit adjacent fisheries.

This study demonstrates that spillover can scale with biomass buildup. As populations inside reserves grew over a decade, the spillover of adult lobsters into adjacent fishing areas grew proportionally. The reserve borders became increasingly productive fishing grounds over time.

The findings have implications for how we evaluate marine reserves as fishery management tools. Assessments conducted shortly after reserve establishment may not capture the benefits that develop as populations compound. Patience is required—both in waiting for biological processes to unfold and in maintaining research programs long enough to document them.

Collaborative fisheries research, where scientists and fishers work together using commercial gear and local knowledge, proved essential for this study. The approach can assess the efficacy of marine reserves as fishery management tools and build trust between the scientific and fishing communities.

    content: `Kurt Ingeman, Lily Zhao, Christopher Wolf, David Williams, Amelia Ritger, William Ripple, Kai Kopecky, Erin Dillon, Bart DiFiore, Joe Curtis, Sam Csik, An Bui, and I applied a 'bright spots' approach to large carnivore conservation—examining cases of recovery to identify factors that distinguish success from failure. In the face of an accelerating extinction crisis, scientists need to draw insights from successful interventions to uncover promising strategies.

Large carnivores represent an ecologically coherent group despite their taxonomic diversity. Their size and position at the top of food chains lead to cascading effects on ecosystems, including promoting biodiversity, altering nutrient cycling, and regulating disease. They are also particularly vulnerable: large range requirements, low reproductive rates, and high potential for human-wildlife conflict make their conservation challenging.

The numbers are sobering. Fewer than 10% of global large carnivore populations are increasing. Only 12 species—3.3% of the 362 we examined—have experienced genuine improvement in extinction risk. Most of these are marine mammals. The majority of large carnivores remain in decline.

What distinguishes the recoveries? Species legislation enacted at national and international levels was strongly associated with positive outcomes, as was management of direct exploitation. Conversely, ongoing declines were robustly linked to habitat modification and human conflict. The pattern suggests that stopping direct killing—through hunting, fishing, or persecution—is essential for recovery.

Some examples illustrate the point. Banning gill nets and protecting spawning aggregations reversed declines in giant sea bass and Nassau grouper. Wolves, bears, and lynx in Europe have largely increased or remained stable due to protection, despite high human population density. The banning of commercial whaling allowed several marine mammal populations to recover.

The findings have implications for conservation strategy. Protecting habitat matters, but for large carnivores with enormous home ranges, habitat protection alone may be insufficient. These animals will always cross boundaries and encounter humans. Recovery requires reducing direct mortality through legislation and enforcement, not just drawing lines on maps.

Applying lessons from these cases of recovery—the few bright spots—will be crucial for restoring intact ecosystems and maintaining the services they provide.

    content: `Raine Detmer, Ross Cunning, Ferdinand Pfab, Alexandra Brown, Roger Nisbet, Holly Moeller, and I used dynamic energy budget modeling to explore a question with no simple answer: how does nitrogen from coral-dwelling fish affect coral bleaching susceptibility?

The starting point was well established. Coral-dwelling fish, particularly damselfish, excrete nitrogen-rich waste that can fertilize their coral hosts. Many studies have shown this promotes coral growth. But bleaching occurs when thermal and other stressors cause the coral-algal symbiosis to break down. Would extra nitrogen help or hurt corals during these stress events?

Our model predicted that fish-derived nitrogen could indeed promote coral growth by supporting the coral-Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis. But the relationship between fish presence and coral tolerance of photo-oxidative stress was non-linear. The extra nitrogen supported denser symbiont populations, and these provided some protection from incident light through self-shading. However, well-fed symbionts also used more of their photosynthetic products for their own growth rather than sharing them with the coral host. This put the coral holobiont at higher risk of becoming carbon-limited and bleaching.

The balance between the benefits of increased symbiont shading and costs of reduced carbon sharing depended on environmental conditions. Under some scenarios, fish presence increased corals' tolerance of light stress. Under others, fish could exacerbate bleaching and slow or prevent subsequent recovery. The outcomes weren't uniform—they depended on parameter regimes that vary across reef environments.

We noted in the paper that the contrast between the potentially harmful effects predicted by our model and some empirical results that show fish benefiting corals during stress may relate to key model assumptions that warrant further investigation. The model provides a foundation but isn't the final word.

What the work highlights is complexity. Coral-associated fauna influence the bioenergetics of their hosts in ways that cascade through to bleaching responses. The same nitrogen fertilization that boosts growth under benign conditions may shift the system toward vulnerability under stress. Understanding these dynamics matters as bleaching events become the primary threat to coral reefs worldwide.

    content: `Kai Kopecky, Dana Cook, Russ Schmitt, and I tested how variation in coral colony density affects coral performance—specifically whether corallivory rates change with coral density. Theory holds that the long-term persistence of populations is facilitated when density alters demographic rates. For corals, a negative relationship between density and population growth could bound populations at high density and promote growth at low density. But very low per capita growth at low densities could destabilize populations and increase extinction risk.

We experimentally quantified the effects of corallivory and coral density on growth and survival of small staghorn coral colonies (Acropora pulchra). Some plots had corallivores excluded; others were exposed to natural predation. Within each treatment, we varied coral density.

Our findings suggest that coral density and corallivory have strong but independent effects on coral performance. This was unexpected. We had hypothesized that corallivory might be density-dependent—that predators would concentrate attacks on high-density patches. Instead, in the presence of corallivores, corals suffered high but density-independent mortality. Predation was severe across all densities.

The density effect emerged when we looked at growth rather than mortality. When corallivores were excluded, vertical extension rates of colonies increased with increasing densities. Denser patches grew faster, possibly due to facilitation effects or environmental amelioration. This positive density-growth relationship only appeared when predation was removed from the picture.

We found no evidence for a predator pit—the theoretical scenario where concentrated corallivory maintains corals at low densities once they've declined. The lack of density-dependent predation means that low coral densities don't necessarily create a trap from which populations can't escape. But our results do suggest that spatio-temporal variation in corallivore and coral densities can fundamentally alter population dynamics via strong effects on juvenile corals.

The findings have implications for coral restoration. The absence of density-dependent predation means that planting corals at high densities doesn't necessarily invite proportionally more predator damage per coral. And if corallivores can be excluded or reduced, denser plantings may actually achieve faster growth. The key is managing predation pressure, not avoiding density.

    content: `Robert Holt, Dominique Gravel, James Rosindell, and I wrote this chapter to explore the interface between food web ecology and spatial ecology. A hidden dimension of food web ecology almost since its inception has been a concern with space and spatial dynamics, though for most of its history, the field has largely focused on local interactions.

The chapter draws on insights from Charles Elton, who maintained interest in the spatial aspects of communities throughout his life. Elton noted that 'the pyramid of numbers, really a pyramid of consumer layers, is matched by the inverse pyramid of habitat.' Species at higher trophic levels often range further and so have to be examined at larger spatial scales. This means species at higher trophic ranks can spatially couple dynamics of communities at lower trophic ranks.

Elton also recognized that no habitat component with its animal community is a closed system. The structural boundaries are constantly passed by population movement. Every community unit is partly interlocked with others, not necessarily its nearest neighbors. This insight anticipates contemporary concern with metacommunity processes.

We discuss several distinct modalities of spatial processes in food web ecology. First, there are attempts to integrate island biogeography and food web theory via influences of food web interactions on colonization and extinction processes generating species occupancy patterns. Second, taxa at different trophic levels can have distinct spatial strategies—for example, the coupling of spatially separated habitats by mobile consumers, related to spatial subsidies and spatial ecosystem ecology. Third, dispersal in metacommunities can permit persistence of otherwise unfeasible configurations.

One of the first food webs ever drawn was Charles Elton's hand-drawn diagram from Bear Island, depicting spatial interactions among marine, terrestrial, and freshwater habitats mediated by the movement of colonial seabirds from foraging grounds to nesting arenas—a process now called spatial subsidy. That spatial perspective has been present in food web thinking from the beginning, even if it has often been overlooked.

For conservation and management, understanding the trophic dimension of species-area relationships matters because habitat fragmentation doesn't affect all species equally. Higher trophic levels, requiring larger areas to sustain their populations, may be disproportionately vulnerable to habitat loss and isolation.

    content: `Raine Detmer, Rob Miller, Dan Reed, Tom Bell, Holly Moeller, and I investigated how disturbance to foundation species cascades through ecological communities. Foundation species—habitat-forming organisms that dominate an ecosystem's biomass—are often disproportionately impacted by disturbance. Because they sit at the base of the network of interactions that shape ecosystems, shifts in their abundance can cascade to affect entire communities.

We focused on giant kelp, which grows rapidly and experiences regular wave disturbance from winter storms. We developed a mathematical model of the effects of variable storm regimes on giant kelp population dynamics and the cascading effects on kelp-mediated competition between benthic community members in kelp forests.

Simulations of severe storm regimes resulted in a greater abundance of understory macroalgae and a lower abundance of sessile invertebrates than did milder regimes. The mechanism involves both direct and indirect effects. Storms directly impact the benthos through scouring. But storms also remove kelp canopy, which releases competition among benthic organisms by increasing light availability and altering water flow.

We validated the model against 20 years of community data from the Santa Barbara Coastal Long-Term Ecological Research program. The model's qualitative predictions were consistent with the empirical patterns, suggesting that interannual variability in disturbance affecting giant kelp abundance can have strong consequences for benthic community structure.

The findings point to the value of long-term studies in elucidating the interacting effects of disturbance and foundation species. Studies of how disturbance and foundation species interact are often hindered by the long life spans and slow growth of most foundation species. Giant kelp's rapid growth made it possible to observe complete cycles of disturbance and recovery within a tractable timeframe.

Understanding these dynamics matters as climate change alters disturbance regimes. If storm patterns intensify or shift in frequency, kelp forest communities won't simply experience proportionally more damage. The cascading effects on community competition will reshape which species thrive and which decline, potentially fundamentally altering benthic community structure.

    content: `Margaret Wilson, Steve Gaines, Ben Halpern, and I documented grazing behavior of two parrotfish species across Caribbean reef sites in Antigua, Barbuda, and Bonaire. Herbivorous fish can play a critical role in coral reef ecosystems by suppressing algae and thereby facilitating coral growth, recruitment, and survival. In recent decades, coral reefs have become increasingly threatened by diverse anthropogenic impacts, including overfishing of herbivorous fish populations.

Insufficient herbivory can allow algae to outcompete corals for space, driving shifts from coral to algal dominance that have occurred across much of the Caribbean region. Coral reef fisheries thus cannot simply manage for sustainable yields—they must also consider the levels of persistent herbivory required to maintain critical ecosystem functions.

Increasing attention has been given to understanding how much herbivory is needed to sustain coral reef health and to identify thresholds of herbivore biomass that can guide fisheries management. However, these targets assume grazing behavior is consistent across different reef systems, even though relatively few have been studied.

Our analyses showed significant differences in intraspecific feeding rates, time spent grazing, and intensity of grazing across sites. The same species exhibited different behaviors depending on location. This variation may alter the ecological impact of a given parrotfish population—two reefs with similar herbivore biomass could have very different amounts of actual grazing.

We suggest several hypothesized mechanisms for these behavioral variations that would benefit from explicit testing in future research. Site-specific factors such as predation risk, food quality, reef structure, or water conditions could influence how actively herbivores feed.

As managers set targets to enhance herbivory on reefs, it is critical that we understand potential differences in grazing impact. Our findings demonstrate the variability of grazing behavior across different reef sites and call for further investigation of the drivers and ecological implications of these inconsistencies. A biomass target that works in one location may not produce the same ecological outcomes elsewhere.

    content: `Jameal Samhouri and I presented empirical evidence from Caribbean Panama suggesting that invasive lionfish impacts may be more nuanced than often assumed. The ecological impacts of invasive species can have major economic, social, and cultural consequences. However, effects of invasive species are not uniformly negative, and there is increasing attention to how impact and function can vary geographically.

On coral reefs, there are few examples of successful invasions by vertebrate predators. A conspicuous exception is the introduction of Indo-Pacific lionfishes to the Atlantic in the 1980s and their rapid spread in the 2000s. Invasive lionfish are voracious generalist predators with venomous spines that act as a built-in defense against native predators.

However, how much lionfish differ from native predators and whether their effects outweigh those of abundant native mesopredators that occupy many reefs invite continued examination. We found that in Caribbean Panama, lionfish are less abundant than native mesopredators. Furthermore, their direct impacts on survivorship and size distributions of one native prey species are similar to those of a native mesopredator.

These results support calls for lionfish management that considers evolving local ecological and social dynamics, including prey community composition, the roles of native mesopredators, and regional goals for conservation and fisheries. In certain localities, invasive species can have null or even positive effects. More generally, invasive species can offer novel socioeconomic opportunities.

Recognition of regional context creates the potential for synergies between conservation actions aimed both at the invasion and other consequential problems such as overexploitation and climate change. Quantifying the ecological and social significance of invasive species in different locations can facilitate understanding trade-offs between costly removals versus a more complex characterization of what it means to accept novel species in social-ecological systems.

The findings don't suggest lionfish are harmless—they are adding predation pressure to Caribbean reefs. But whether they require unique management responses compared to managing native predator populations and other stressors may depend on regional context.

    content: `Justin Baumann, Lily Zhao, John Bruno, and I tested a hypothesis that many coral biologists wanted to believe: that remote reefs, far from human impacts like fishing and pollution, would prove more resilient to climate change. If remote areas could maintain their resilience, they might serve as biodiversity arks capable of repopulating more degraded locations.

We compiled a global database of 57 peer-reviewed studies that tracked coral cover through disturbances—bleaching events, storms, predator outbreaks, and disease—across 182 reef sites spanning the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, and Pacific. We measured both resistance (how much coral cover declined during disturbance) and recovery (how fast coral cover rebounded afterward), then tested whether remoteness from humans predicted either.

The results were sobering. We found no relationship between human influence and resistance to disturbance. Remote reefs didn't resist bleaching or storms any better than reefs near cities. Perhaps more surprisingly, some evidence suggested that reefs near large human populations may actually recover from disturbance faster than their more isolated counterparts.

The finding challenges a comforting narrative in coral conservation: that if we can't save reefs near people, at least remote reefs will persist. They probably won't. Remote coral reefs are imperiled by climate change like so many other geographically isolated ecosystems. Isolation doesn't protect them from warming oceans or ocean acidification. The disturbances that are killing reefs operate at global scales, and remoteness provides no refuge.

The implications for conservation are significant. Remote reefs are unlikely to serve as effective biodiversity arks. Only drastic and rapid cuts in greenhouse gas emissions will ensure coral survival. Local management matters for many reasons, but it cannot compensate for climate change. The data also suggest that focusing research and conservation resources on accessible reefs near human populations—some of which showed surprising resilience—may maximize conservation outcomes.

We kept hoping the data would show something different. It didn't.

    content: `Hunter Lenihan, Jordan Gallagher, Joe Peters, Jennifer Hofmeister, Dan Reed, and I tested whether an increase in lobster populations inside two newly established marine protected areas influenced local catch, fishing effort, and catch-per-unit-effort within the sustainable California spiny lobster fishery.

Marine protected areas are widely recognized as effective conservation tools, but whether positive conservation outcomes also benefit fisheries is less certain yet important to assess. Many MPAs are established with assurances to local fisheries that the capacity to increase fish stocks and yield will outweigh costs associated with loss of fishing grounds.

MPAs are thought to enhance adjacent fisheries mainly through increased export of eggs and larvae that augment populations of target species, or through spillover of biomass from reserve borders into fished areas. Patterns of density-driven spillover have most often been observed for exploited species of mobile invertebrates, especially lobsters, because they can be intensively fished using stationary traps placed at reserve borders.

We found greater build-up of lobsters within MPAs relative to unprotected areas, and greater increases in fishing effort and total lobster catch—but not catch-per-unit-effort—in fishing zones containing MPAs compared to those without MPAs. The key finding was this: a 35% reduction in fishing area resulting from MPA designation was compensated for by a 225% increase in total catch after 6 years. This indicates at a local scale that the trade-off of fishing ground for no-fishing zones benefited the fishery.

The result supports theoretical predictions that MPAs can enhance adjacent fisheries when biomass builds up inside reserves and spills over the boundaries. Not all reserves show this pattern—spiny lobsters have even been documented spilling into MPAs in some cases. But for these California reserves, the spillover mechanism appears to be working.

The trade-off facing fishers is clear: short-term costs from reduced fishing grounds, followed by long-term gains from increased catch in adjacent areas. The 6-year timeline in this study represents a relatively rapid return on investment, though the pattern likely continued strengthening in subsequent years. For fisheries managers considering new MPAs, this evidence helps make the case that reserves can benefit both conservation and fishing interests.

    content: `Margaret Wilson, April Ridlon, Kaitlyn Gaynor, Steve Gaines, Ben Halpern, and I synthesized literature on human-induced animal behavior change to create a framework for examining ecological consequences. A growing body of research has documented widespread human impacts on animal behavior across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, yet the ultimate ecological consequences of these behavioral shifts remain largely uninvestigated.

We identified four mechanisms through which human activities affect animal behavior. First, by changing population densities—for example, culling can alter territorial behaviors and social dynamics. Second, through top-down effects where humans alter how and where animals perceive risk; humans play the ecological role of 'super predators' in many systems. Third, through bottom-up effects where human activity changes the availability and distribution of prey or resources. Fourth, through physical environment effects where habitat modifications or sensory pollution alter environmental conditions and sensory cues.

These mechanisms can induce changes across the full range of animal behaviors: foraging, movement, communication, timing and distribution of activities, vigilance and flight, rest and hygiene, and breeding and parental care. Each of these behavioral categories can potentially cascade to affect population dynamics, community structure, and ecosystem functions including nutrient cycling, primary production, habitat modification, pollination and seed dispersal, disturbance regulation, and pathogen transfer.

The best evidence for ecosystem consequences comes from systems where humans have altered animal foraging behaviors. For example, fishing-depleted piscivore populations can modify foraging behaviors of herbivorous fish, contributing to seascape-level differences in algal distribution patterns. However, most pathways in our framework remain empirically untested.

Numerous factors can dampen these pathways. The spatial and temporal distribution of human disturbance matters—infrequent or localized impacts may not translate into behavioral changes with ecological relevance. Species' behavioral plasticity can buffer against disturbance. And the complexity of ecological networks means that changes in one component may be compensated by others.

We advocate for research that goes beyond documenting behavioral impacts to examine potential realized ecological implications. The framework presented can help anticipate the nature and likelihood of ecological outcomes and prioritize management among widespread human-induced behavioral shifts.

    content: `Andrew Olaf Shelton, Jameal Samhouri, Blake Feist, Phil Levin, and I explored changes in spatial asynchrony in Pacific herring populations of Haida Gwaii, a remote archipelago off the coast of British Columbia. Herring are ecologically, commercially, and culturally valuable fish that support both industrial and indigenous fisheries. Major stock declines in 1967 and 1994 resulted in the closure of the commercial fishery.

We fit a Bayesian state-space model to 65 years of spatially explicit spawn and catch records from 11 herring subpopulations. This approach allowed us to quantify how population growth, climate, and fishing have contributed to herring dynamics at local and regional scales.

Our results highlighted the importance of spatial structure in understanding population dynamics. Archipelago-wide long-term growth rates averaged about 6% per year. Regional ocean conditions, captured by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, strongly influenced herring—population growth increased in cooler years and decreased in warmer years.

Commercial harvest historically appeared to hover around typical annual exploitation rates of about 15% at the archipelago scale. However, local harvest rates were much higher when fishing occurred—as high as 65%. This spatial mismatch between where fishing concentrated and how managers assessed sustainability contributed to local declines even when regional assessments suggested the fishery was sustainable.

We documented the erosion of the herring portfolio over time. Historically, spatially asynchronous subpopulations provided regional reliability because when one local population declined, others compensated. This portfolio effect has weakened. The spatial asynchrony that buffered the metapopulation against environmental variability has declined, leaving the system more vulnerable to coordinated collapse.

Our results suggest that developing herring management strategies at finer spatial scales may ensure greater regional resource reliability by recovering previous levels of spatial population asynchrony. However, doing so may require higher implementation and monitoring costs. Such place-based solutions that match the spatial scale of governance to the spatial scale of ecological dynamics have the potential to improve future management in an increasingly dynamic world.

    content: `Dan Okamoto, Margot Hessing-Lewis, Jameal Samhouri, Andrew Shelton, Phil Levin, Anne Salomon, and I explored why unanticipated declines among exploited species commonly occur despite harvests that appeared sustainable prior to collapse. This is particularly true in the oceans where spatial scales of management are often mismatched with spatially complex metapopulations.

We explored causes, consequences, and potential solutions for spatial mismatches in harvested metapopulations in three ways. First, we generated novel theory illustrating when and how harvesting metapopulations increases spatial variability and in turn masks local-scale volatility. Second, we illustrated why spatial variability in harvested metapopulations leads to negative consequences using an empirical example of a Pacific herring metapopulation. Third, we constructed a numerical management strategy evaluation model to identify and highlight potential solutions.

Our results highlight that spatial complexity can promote stability at large scales. This is a key feature of metapopulation dynamics—when local populations fluctuate asynchronously, the aggregate can appear stable even when individual populations experience substantial variability. However, ignoring spatial complexity produces cryptic and negative consequences for people and animals that interact with resources at small scales.

The herring case study was particularly instructive. The aggregate population signal remained stable while local spawning aggregations were being depleted. Communities that depended on specific local populations experienced collapse even as managers, watching the larger-scale signal, concluded that the fishery was sustainable.

Harvesting metapopulations magnifies the problem. Fishing effort often concentrates on the most accessible or productive local populations, driving them down while less-fished populations remain healthy. The aggregate—which averages across all populations—shows less decline than any individual depleted stock. This mismatch between local reality and aggregate signal can persist until the spatial structure that supported resilience has been eroded.

The management implications are significant. Monitoring and assessment approaches that aggregate across space may provide misleading signals of sustainability. Better matching spatial scales of management to the scales at which metapopulations function could provide earlier warning of trouble and prevent the kind of cryptic collapse we documented.

    content: `Thomas Lamy, Craig Koenigs, Sally Holbrook, Rob Miller, Dan Reed, and I tested the hypothesis that the stability of a marine foundation species increases the stability of the associated community. Foundation species structure communities, promote biodiversity, and stabilize ecosystem processes by creating locally stable environmental conditions. Despite their critical importance, the role of foundation species in stabilizing natural communities has seldom been quantified.

In theory, the stability of a foundation species should promote community stability by enhancing species richness, altering the population fluctuations of individual species, or both. We used giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, as our model system. We analyzed an 18-year time series of biomass data collected from 32 plots distributed among nine shallow reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel.

We showed that the stability of understory algae and sessile invertebrates was positively and indirectly related to the stability of giant kelp. This relationship primarily resulted from giant kelp's direct positive association with species richness. The kelp itself wasn't directly dampening community fluctuations—instead, it was promoting diversity, and diversity was promoting stability.

The stability of all community types was positively related to species richness via two mechanisms: increased species stability (individual species populations were more stable in diverse communities) and increased species asynchrony (species populations fluctuated out of phase with each other, so declines in some were offset by increases in others).

A key finding was that the stabilizing effects of richness were three to four times stronger when algae and invertebrates were considered separately rather than in combination. Our interpretation is that diversity-stability relationships were stronger in communities consisting of species with similar resource requirements. This suggests that competition for shared resources rather than differential responses to environmental conditions played a more important role in stabilizing the community.

The findings have implications for understanding and predicting ecosystem responses to environmental change. Increasing threats to foundation species like giant kelp—from warming temperatures, marine heat waves, and other stressors—may affect community stability not just by removing habitat structure, but by reducing the diversity that the foundation species promotes. Conservation of foundation species may be essential for maintaining the stability of the communities that depend on them.

Recent warnings from scientists suggest there is limited time to enact policies to avert wide-ranging ecological and social damage from climate change. In the United States, discussions about comprehensive national policies have begun, with Green New Deal proposals and climate plans put forth by members of Congress and presidential candidates.

Oceans are largely absent or separate from these nascent policy proposals. This is a significant oversight. Oceans play a central role in the climate system—absorbing heat and carbon dioxide, regulating weather patterns, and supporting ecosystems and economies that depend on marine resources.

We highlight a policy framework to develop terrestrial and ocean-integrated policies that can complement and enhance each other. Rather than treating land and sea as separate domains requiring separate policy approaches, integrated frameworks can identify synergies and avoid conflicts between climate actions on land and in the ocean.

Blue carbon ecosystems like mangroves, seagrass beds, and salt marshes sequester carbon at rates comparable to or exceeding terrestrial forests. Offshore renewable energy offers vast potential for decarbonizing electricity generation. Sustainable fisheries management can maintain food security while protecting marine ecosystems. Coastal resilience investments can protect communities from sea level rise and intensifying storms.

The absence of oceans from climate policy may reflect the land-centric framing of most environmental discourse and the jurisdictional complexity of ocean governance. But the consequences of this oversight could be severe. Climate policies that ignore marine dimensions may miss cost-effective mitigation opportunities, fail to protect vulnerable coastal communities, and inadvertently harm ocean ecosystems through poorly designed land-based interventions.

Any comprehensive climate policy needs a splash of blue. The framework we propose can help policymakers integrate ocean considerations into terrestrial climate discussions, identify win-win opportunities across the land-sea interface, and ensure that the rush to address climate change doesn't leave the ocean behind.

    content: `Phil Levin, Steven Gray, Christian Möllmann, and I explored why conflict is so ubiquitous in conservation and resource management. Although conflicts can be important drivers of positive environmental change, they are frequently costly and damage conservation goals.

Environmental conflicts are frequently attributed to differences in values. However, variability in the perception of facts, rooted in social and cultural differences, also underlies conflicts. We call this phenomenon the Rashomon effect, after the Kurosawa film where witnesses describe the same event completely differently. Each honestly perceives and remembers a different version based on where they stood and what they valued.

The conservation Rashomon effect results from a combination of differences in perspective, plausible alternative perspectives of a conservation issue, and the absence of evidence to elevate one perspective above others. When these three conditions exist, stakeholders can genuinely perceive the same environmental situation differently without anyone being dishonest or ignorant.

As a remedy to the Rashomon effect, policy-makers have turned to scientists as honest brokers who share a common environmental reality. We evaluated this supposition and suggest that scientists, themselves, display Rashomon effects. Scientists aren't immune to selective attention. Their methods determine what they see; their training shapes what they notice. The idea of scientists as neutral arbiters may be more comforting than accurate.

We suggest that Rashomon effects can be reduced by acknowledging the plurality of reality, embracing epistemic pluralism, and prioritizing an inclusive process of resource management. Rather than insisting on a single 'true' account, effective conflict resolution may require acknowledging multiple valid perspectives.

The hardest part for scientists may be accepting that they are participants in the Rashomon effect, not observers outside it. Conservation might make more progress if we stopped trying to determine whose perception is 'correct' and started asking what we can accomplish together despite seeing different truths.

Growing scientific awareness, strong regulations, and effective management have begun to fulfill the promise of recovery. Unfortunately, many efforts remain unsuccessful, in part because marine ecosystems and human societies are changing.

We proposed that recovery targets are moving targets in three dimensions. First, temporal shifts in environmental conditions can alter both what recovery looks like and whether interventions remain effective. The North Atlantic right whale exemplifies this challenge. This species experienced steady recovery from whaling until rapid warming in the Gulf of Maine caused unprecedented reproductive failure by reducing copepod prey productivity. At the same time, successful vessel-strike avoidance measures are now needed in new locations as right whales have followed prey poleward into the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

Second, spatial heterogeneity and connectivity mean that recovery success at one scale may not translate to another. Pacific herring spawn in discrete nearshore habitats, creating populations that fluctuate out of sync with one another. Regional-scale harvest limits can appear sustainable while allowing local populations to fail. Some traditionally occupied spawning sites have been lost over time, reducing the spatial diversity necessary to buffer against changing conditions.

Third, human perceptions of what defines successful recovery can vary substantially based on how an individual interacts with and values a species or ecosystem. Sea otter recovery increases ecosystem services associated with kelp dominance, while otter-free habitats offer alternative cultural, economic, and conservation value to different stakeholders.

We argued for three ways forward. Society can rethink an inclusive definition of recovery that recognizes multiple recovery goals—from minimum viability to maximum carrying capacity, with legitimate alternative targets in between. Research can help anticipate future recovery dynamics and identify pathways toward resilient ecosystems. And policy-makers can embrace nimble approaches that keep pace with change and integrate governance from local to regional scales.

Application of these principles can facilitate successful recoveries in a world where environmental conditions and social imperatives are constantly shifting.

    content: `Bartholomew DiFiore, Simon Queenborough, Elizabeth Madin, Valerie Paul, Mary Beth Decker, and I investigated what causes the remarkable variation in grazing halo size across Caribbean coral reef ecosystems. Grazing halos—barren areas of sand surrounding coral patch reefs—are readily visible in satellite images, yet their width can vary from less than one meter to nearly 70 meters.

We combined a landscape analysis of 757 patch reefs in Florida and Belize with mensurative field experiments at 13 patch reefs. At each field site, we deployed standardized seagrass assays at increasing distances from reef edges to measure how grazing intensity changed with distance, while also surveying fish communities to quantify predator and herbivore densities.

Grazing consistently declined with distance from the reef edge—herbivores forage heavily close to the coral where predation risk and travel costs are low, and less intensely farther from shelter. We hypothesized that predation risk would be the primary driver of variation in halo size, but our results told a more nuanced story.

Predators did suppress grazing. When predator density doubled, overall grazing intensity declined by 29%. However, predator density did not alter the spatial distribution of grazing—it didn't change how far herbivores ventured from the reef. Instead, herbivore density and patch reef area were the best predictors of how far herbivores foraged and of halo width itself. Larger reefs with more herbivores had wider halos.

This finding initially seemed counterintuitive. We expected that larger herbivore populations would graze more intensively close to the reef, creating narrower halos. But the pattern was the opposite. The mechanism likely involves competition: when herbivore densities are high, individuals must venture farther from the reef to find ungrazed resources, expanding the halo.

Across 757 patch reefs analyzed from satellite imagery, patch reef area was strongly correlated with halo width, confirming that the local patterns we documented scale up to landscape-level predictions. These results suggest that grazing halos may function as footprints of ecological processes—patterns visible from space that encode information about herbivore populations and their foraging behavior below.

    content: `Sarah Lee, Mary O'Connor, and I tested whether temporal variation in dispersal modifies the well-described relationship between dispersal and biodiversity. Theory predicts communities connected by high dispersal will exhibit greater similarity in species composition than those linked by infrequent dispersal. But most evidence comes from studies assuming constant dispersal rates. Real dispersal is variable—larvae disperse in pulses tied to lunar cycles, seeds release in bursts following fruiting, migratory animals move in seasonal waves.

We re-analyzed data from an experiment manipulating both the intensity and variability of grazer dispersal in seagrass mesocosms. The experiment crossed four levels of dispersal intensity with two levels of variability: single pulse versus weekly additions. This allowed us to test whether when dispersal happens matters as much as how much happens.

Higher dispersal intensity increased grazer abundance and alpha diversity, consistent with classical predictions. But the effects on beta diversity—the compositional dissimilarity among patches—depended critically on temporal variability. When dispersal was variable (single pulse), higher intensity led to lower beta diversity. When dispersal occurred in multiple additions (low variability), the patterns differed.

Within each dispersal intensity level, temporal variation in dispersal decreased alpha diversity and increased beta diversity, with strongest effects at low and intermediate intensities. Pulsed arrival and constant trickle, even averaging to similar total arrivals, produced completely different communities across patches.

Two mechanisms could explain these patterns. First, metacommunity theory predicts temporal variability in dispersal can produce unique diversity patterns by altering when competitive exclusion occurs. Second, Jensen's inequality—a mathematical property of nonlinear functions—predicts that variation around any mean dispersal rate will increase beta diversity relative to fixed dispersal at that same mean.

For conservation, these findings suggest that corridor planning based on average permeability may miss important dynamics. A corridor that opens in seasonal pulses might function differently than one that allows constant movement, even if average connectivity is identical. Climate change adds urgency: warming doesn't just shift averages but changes timing and variability of dispersal events.

    content: `Justin Pretorius, James Lichtenstein, Erika Eliason, Jonathan Pruitt, and I examined how individual variation in purple sea urchin behavior and body size affect susceptibility to predation by California spiny lobsters. Classical theory predicts that more active animals will be more susceptible to predation, particularly when facing sit-and-pursue predators like lobsters.

We first established that individual urchins show consistent behavioral differences. Activity level showed repeatability of 0.30 across testing days, and covering behavior—the tendency to conceal themselves with pebble substrate—showed even higher repeatability of 0.73. These consistent individual differences set the stage for asking whether they influence survival.

In staged predator-prey interactions lasting 108 hours, we placed groups of four urchins with individual lobsters and tracked survival. Urchin survival rate was about 33%. The results supported classical predictions but with an important twist: high activity level was negatively associated with survival, but the effect depended on urchin size.

For small urchins, being active was costly. Slow-moving small urchins survived more frequently than fast-moving ones. The Locomotor Crossover Hypothesis predicts exactly this pattern: sit-and-pursue predators should tend to encounter and consume active prey rather than sedentary ones. But for large urchins, activity level predicted survival much less clearly. Once urchins reach a certain size, they can apparently move about with less risk of being eaten—size itself becomes protection.

Covering behavior alone did not predict survival directly. However, for smaller urchins, those with greater covering behavior were more likely to survive. Large urchins survived regardless of whether they covered themselves.

These findings suggest that the age and size structure of urchin populations may determine whether and how lobster predation applies selection pressure on urchin behavior. As lobster populations recover from historical fishing pressure, they may selectively cull active phenotypes from urchin populations. This could alter the dynamics of urchin-kelp interactions, potentially influencing whether coastal ecosystems remain as kelp forests or shift to urchin barrens.

    content: `José Muelbert, Nicholas Nidzieko, and a large team of coauthors including myself explored the potential for ILTER coastal and marine sites to contribute to global ocean observation. Human activities threaten both the natural functioning of coastal and marine ecosystems and their sustainable use by future generations. Developing the ecological knowledge necessary to quantify these threats requires long-term observations that most research funding cycles cannot support.

ILTER currently consists of 44 national networks managing more than 700 sites worldwide. Among these, approximately 70 coastal sites and 60 marine sites monitor a variety of habitats including sand dunes, beaches, lagoons, estuaries, river deltas, fjords, salt marshes, mangroves, and continental shelf ecosystems.

The long history of many sites enhances their value for detecting global change. Nearly half of the coastal and marine sites include data records that precede the formal establishment of ILTER. The Dutch Wadden Sea Area has records dating to 1872. Observations began in the Western Gulf of Finland in 1902, the Mar Piccolo of Taranto in 1914, and Shirahama, Japan in 1922.

We analyzed the potential contribution of ILTER-CMS using a SWOT framework. Among the strengths: multi-disciplinary data acquisition, long time spans enabling trend detection, and institutional continuity that outlasts individual scientists. Among the weaknesses: sites developed from the bottom-up with varying methods, harmonization of data still incomplete, and ILTER was not designed as an operational monitoring system.

Opportunities include serving as pilot sites for integrated biological observatories, promoting new technologies for ocean observation, and contributing to monitoring Essential Ocean Variables at global scale. ILTER can also provide a platform for citizen science activities that improve observation frequency and geographic coverage.

The ILTER community has produced tools to harmonize and compare measurements and methods, allowing data integration between and within sites. The Dynamic Ecological Information Management System provides a common metadata catalog. Looking ahead, we recommended further developing observational activities and improving coordination among sites and with external initiatives to maximize their contribution to addressing present and future challenges in ocean observation.

    content: `Chris Jerde, Krista Kraskura, Erika Eliason, Sam Csik, Mark Taper, and I applied an evidentialist statistical framework to one of the longest-standing controversies in ecology: the scaling relationship between metabolic rate and body mass. The textbooks say metabolism scales with body mass to the power of 0.75, a number that underpins metabolic theory and countless predictions about how much animals need to eat. We tested whether the data actually support this value.

We curated metabolic data from 25 published studies with 55 independent trials across 16 fish species. We applied flexible mixed effects models and used the Schwarz Information Criterion as an evidence function to evaluate competing hypotheses about the scaling exponent.

Our analysis found strong evidence for a metabolic scaling coefficient of 0.89, with an interval spanning 0.82 to 0.99. This means the commonly assumed values of 0.67, 0.75, and 1 are not supported by the data. The difference matters more than it might seem. An exponent of 0.89 versus 0.75 changes predictions about metabolic demands substantially across the range of body sizes fish achieve.

Previous disagreement about the scaling exponent stemmed partly from mixing within-species and across-species comparisons. These are different questions. Our analysis focused specifically on intraspecific scaling—how metabolism changes as individual fish grow—and found consistent support for values higher than the canonical 0.75.

Model selection also supported using random intercepts and random slopes by species, suggesting that factors like taxonomy or lifestyle characteristics influence the relationship. This is consistent with the idea that there may not be a single universal exponent, but rather a distribution of values influenced by ecology and physiology.

The evidentialist framework we applied allows for refinement as additional data become available. The question of metabolic scaling is far from closed, but our analysis provides strong evidence that the intraspecific value for fish is closer to 0.89 than to the values mechanistic theory has proposed.

    content: `Elizabeth Hamman, Scott McKinley, Craig Osenberg, and I developed a model to investigate how spatial patterns can be created in a landscape of identical habitat patches. Higher quality patches typically have higher organism densities because they attract more colonists or confer better survival. But what if patches are identical? Can landscape configuration alone produce spatial variation in density?

We modeled a system where neighboring patches redirect potential colonists away from focal patches—a phenomenon we call propagule redirection. When a larval fish arrives and perceives signals from multiple corals, it chooses one. Corals surrounded by neighbors lose potential colonists to those neighbors. Isolated corals capture colonists from a larger surrounding area.

We simulated colonization and post-colonization dynamics across three landscape types: evenly distributed patches, randomly distributed patches, and clustered patches. In evenly distributed landscapes, all patches had similar neighborhoods, so propagule redirection affected all patches equally. In clustered landscapes, some patches were surrounded by competitors while others sat isolated—creating dramatic variation in colonization.

The maximum and minimum settlement rates varied 4.7-fold in clustered landscapes, compared to 2.9-fold in even landscapes. This heterogeneity translated into long-term spatial variation in occupant density when density-dependent mortality was moderate. But when density dependence was strong, large cohorts were quickly reduced, eliminating the spatial variation established during colonization.

We applied our framework to a reef fish system, parameterizing the model with empirical data. Propagule redirection produced spatial variation comparable to what would be expected from variation in habitat quality. Two corals identical in size and structure can support different fish populations simply because one happens to be isolated while the other is surrounded by neighbors.

As landscapes change through disturbance, development, or restoration, these spatial effects shift. Adding new habitat patches may not increase total colonization proportionally if colonists are simply redistributed among patches. Understanding propagule redirection helps predict how populations may respond as landscapes change under natural and anthropogenic forces.

    content: `Chris Stallings, Jameal Samhouri, Mark Albins, Glenn Almany, and I synthesized existing experiments to quantify the role of predation in driving changes in abundance and biodiversity of recently settled reef fishes. Declines in apex predator populations can cause irruptions in mesopredator abundance—a phenomenon of particular concern for coral reefs where fishing has disproportionately reduced top predators.

Settling fishes experience extraordinarily high predation rates, with an average of 50% mortality in their first 48 hours on the reef—a 'predation gauntlet.' We asked whether mesopredators running this gauntlet affect prey biodiversity beyond simply reducing abundance.

Across 10 experiments, mesopredators had substantial effects. Prey communities with predators had 60% lower abundance and 35% lower gamma diversity. Alpha diversity was reduced 36%. These numbers suggest predation dramatically reshapes prey communities.

But rarefaction told a different story. When we corrected for abundance effects—asking whether predators changed diversity beyond what would be expected from reduced numbers—the effects disappeared. Rarefied alpha diversity showed no change. Rarefied beta diversity showed no change. The mesopredators synthesized here were generalist predators that reduced prey abundance equally across species.

This is both reassuring and concerning. It's reassuring because generalist predation doesn't selectively eliminate rare species or fundamentally restructure prey communities. It's concerning because it means extremely high abundance of mesopredators—as from invasive lionfish—could drive prey to such low abundances that demographic stochasticity causes extinctions even without selective predation.

Two predator species were notable exceptions. The dottyback Pseudochromis fuscus and peacock grouper Cephalopholis argus disproportionately affected rare species, significantly lowering rarefied diversity. The peacock grouper finding is concerning because this non-native species, introduced to Hawaii in the 1950s, now constitutes over 80% of large piscivore biomass in some locations.

Lionfish effects fell within the distribution observed for native predators and showed no evidence of targeting rare species. Their conservation threat comes from overwhelming abundance rather than selective predation. This paper is dedicated to the memory of Glenn Almany, who passed away before the manuscript could be completed.

In the absence of certainty about complex social-ecological systems, expert opinions are often elicited to inform conservation decisions. However, experts can exhibit high levels of uncertainty, and their perceptions often diverge.

We asked 27 experts with diverse backgrounds to describe the number, direction, and strength of food web interactions among 14 functional groups connected to herring in Haida Gwaii, British Columbia. From these responses we constructed Fuzzy Cognitive Maps—mathematical representations of each expert's perception of ecosystem structure—and then simulated how each expert's unique mental model would respond to three perturbations: increased herring, increased humpback whales, and increased zooplankton.

Expert perceptions diverged substantially in structure. Networks varied widely in number of connections (42 to 125), interaction strengths, and whether relationships were hierarchical or democratic. Surprisingly, demographic characteristics—years of experience, professional affiliation, place of residence—did not predict this variation. Cluster analysis revealed two distinct groups of experts with different perceptions, but these groups didn't correspond to any demographic categories.

The functional consequences of structural divergence were revealing. When we simulated increases in herring predators (whales) or prey (zooplankton), expert predictions showed relative consensus. But when we simulated the scenario of central management interest—a herring increase—expert predictions diverged dramatically. One cluster predicted 182% greater ecosystem reorganization and 78% higher average change in functional group abundances compared to the other cluster.

The divergence centered on herring itself. Experts disagreed most about how strongly herring affects the surrounding food web. Using this approach to determine the logical consequences of expert perceptions, decision-makers can work explicitly toward filling knowledge gaps while embracing a diversity of perspectives. Recognizing where experts agree and where they diverge is the first step toward navigating ecosystem-based conservation decisions.

    content: `Jameal Samhouri, Shannon Hennessey, Mark Novak, Ben Halpern, Phil Levin, and I developed theory to address one of the twenty-first century's greatest environmental challenges: recovering and restoring species, habitats, and ecosystems. The decision about how to initiate restoration is best informed by understanding the linkages between ecosystem components and the consequences of recovering one component before another.

We developed a dynamical systems model of an apex predator consuming prey, then evaluated the effectiveness of three recovery strategies: synchronous recovery (simultaneously releasing both predators and prey from harvest), prey-first recovery (releasing prey from harvest before predators), and predator-first recovery (releasing predators first).

Surprisingly, synchronous recovery from sustainable exploitation levels produces recoveries that are faster than either sequential strategy. Synchronous recovery can be twice as fast and produce transient fluctuations of much lower amplitude than prey-first recovery. The key insight is that simultaneous release allows both populations to rebuild together, with each supporting the other's recovery.

Predator-first recovery is particularly slow. Releasing predators first while continuing to exploit prey creates a double jeopardy for prey: they face both harvest pressure and increased mortality from recovering predators. Prey-first recovery is faster than predator-first but still slower than synchronous because erupting prey populations create transient dynamics that complicate recovery trajectories.

We then asked whether real-world recoveries follow these patterns. Analysis of a comprehensive database of marine fisheries showed that synchronous and sequential recoveries are similarly common. This suggests current practices are not ideal—if synchronous recovery is generally faster and more direct, the fact that half of recoveries are sequential represents missed efficiency gains.

We highlighted several policy mechanisms that could facilitate synchronous recovery, including protected areas that release all species from harvest simultaneously, mixed-stock management approaches, and umbrella species strategies. The critical component is embracing systems-level thinking for restoration policy and practice—coordinating management actions across species rather than managing stock by stock in isolation.

    content: `Jameal Samhouri, Kelly Andrews, Gavin Fay, Chris Harvey, Elliott Hazen, Shannon Hennessey, Kirstin Holsman, Mary Hunsicker, Scott Large, Kristin Marshall, Jamie Tam, Stephani Zador, and I developed a framework to define ecosystem-based thresholds for human and environmental pressures. The California Current is changing more rapidly than ever before. What remains unclear is how to evaluate whether conditions have changed enough to provoke major responses in species, habitats, and communities.

We developed an analytical framework centered on multi-model inference rather than a single statistical tool. The framework includes pre-treatment (data scoping and preparation), screening for nonlinearities, functional form identification, and threshold identification. We applied this to two decades of data from the California Current, exploring relationships between nine ecosystem state indicators and sixteen pressures.

Our analyses identified threshold responses of five ecosystem states to four environmental and two human pressures. Both gradient forest and GAM methods agreed on threshold relationships in two cases: the winter copepod anomaly responding to habitat modification, and sea lion pup production responding to the summer Pacific Decadal Oscillation.

Considered collectively, the analyses suggest that as many as five of the nine ecosystem states—copepods, scavengers, groundfish, and marine mammals—may exhibit threshold changes in response to negative PDO values in summer. This result is consistent with the known influence of the PDO across multiple trophic levels, but extends current knowledge by defining the nonlinear nature of these responses. When PDO crosses certain values, the ecosystem doesn't respond gradually—it shifts.

This research provides a new way to interpret changes in human and environmental pressures as they relate to ecological integrity. By defining where thresholds occur and how large the associated shifts may be, managers can make more informed assessments of when intervention, preparation, and mitigation may enhance progress toward ecosystem-based management goals. The multi-model inference framework we developed has broad application to other regions working to operationalize ecosystem-based management.

    content: `John Lynham, Ben Halpern, Tim Blenckner, Tim Essington, Jim Estes, Mary Hunsicker, Carrie Kappel, Anne Salomon, Courtney Scarborough, Kimberly Selkoe, and I explored how costly stakeholder participation can lock marine ecosystems into altered states. Ecosystems often shift abruptly between different regimes in response to human or natural disturbances. When ecosystems tip, the suite of available benefits changes, creating stakeholders who stand to lose if the system returns to its previous state.

Economic theory predicts that if participation costs are high, stakeholder meetings will be dominated by extreme viewpoints. Stakeholders whose favorite policy is near the anticipated outcome don't attend because their participation wouldn't move the outcome enough to justify the cost. Only those with extreme preferences—who stand to gain or lose a lot—pay the cost to participate.

We illustrated this dynamic with two case studies. In the North Pacific, sea otters historically maintained kelp forests by controlling sea urchins. When otters were hunted to near-extinction, urchin populations exploded and lucrative shellfisheries developed. Now, efforts to restore otters face opposition from shellfish industries whose livelihoods depend on the otter-free state. In the Gulf of Maine, overfishing of cod triggered a regime shift. The ecosystem is now a lobster monoculture worth hundreds of millions annually. Communities have adapted, younger generations know only the lobster economy, and inertia against restoring ecological diversity grows stronger.

The decision-making institutions used to manage these systems compound ecological hysteresis. US fishery management requires public hearings, but participation is costly—time preparing comments, travel to meetings, foregone earnings. Decisions about Hawaii fisheries are sometimes made at meetings in American Samoa or Guam. Under these conditions, theory predicts that meetings will be dominated by extremists and produce extreme policy outcomes.

Even if the majority of society prefers restoration, the structure of participatory governance can prevent that outcome. Just as ecological feedback loops make it harder to exit an ecosystem regime, decision-making feedback loops contribute additional inertia. Understanding these dynamics can inform design of governance systems that reduce participation costs or otherwise ensure that policy outcomes represent majority preferences rather than the views of those most willing to pay the cost of showing up.

    content: `Shane Geange, Davina Poulos, Mark McCormick, and I investigated whether the sequence of species colonization (priority effects) or the number of arriving individuals (colonizer abundance) has a stronger influence on reef fish survival. Priority effects are increasingly recognized as important determinants of community structure, yet their importance relative to colonizer abundance is seldom assessed.

We factorially manipulated both factors using settlement-stage damselfish on patch reefs at Lizard Island. Two Ambon damselfish were introduced either simultaneously with, or 3 hours before, either 2 or 6 lemon damselfish. A 3-hour priority period is ecologically relevant because reef fishes settle over several hours overnight and competitive interactions are strongest immediately following settlement.

The results were striking. Sequence of arrival had a much stronger effect on survival than the number of competing individuals. Late-arriving lemon damselfish experienced 76% higher mortality compared to simultaneous arrivals. In contrast, increasing lemon damselfish abundance from 2 to 6 individuals did not produce statistically significant effects on mortality, although the trend suggested some effect.

Behavioral observations revealed the mechanisms. Late-arriving lemon damselfish were less aggressive and 2.7 times more likely to avoid competitive interactions compared to those arriving simultaneously with Ambon damselfish. Interestingly, aggression by Ambon damselfish did not differ between treatments, suggesting that reduced aggression in late-arriving lemon damselfish reflected submission rather than reduced provocation.

Previous work has shown that competition increases exposure of subordinate fish to predators due to displacement from refuge habitat. The inability to find and defend shelter sites may explain decreased survival of late-arriving fish.

The priority effect on survival was approximately 1.5 times greater than the effect of abundance variation. This suggests that for reef fish colonization, when you arrive matters more than how many arrive. If these results are generally applicable, focusing only on colonizer numbers without considering timing of arrival relative to established residents will reduce the accuracy of predictions for fisheries management, invasive species control, and reef restoration.

Many of the most iconic species in the natural world are apex predators, yet their recovery remains elusive even after hunting is reduced or eliminated.

Full recovery of viable apex predator populations is currently the exception rather than the rule. Slow life history characteristics—large body size, low reproductive rates, small population sizes—certainly contribute. Continued exploitation and poaching remain problems. But we argue that several underappreciated factors complicate predator recoveries.

First, identifying which trophic interactions will influence recovery is difficult. Resource limitation can constrain recovery when prey populations are depleted or when recovering predators compete with established mesopredators. The relationship between prey availability and predator success is nonlinear—ensuring some prey supply is critical, but the marginal value of higher supplies may not warrant extra costs because predators can be limited by factors other than food.

Second, the timing of recovery matters because it determines competitive outcomes. When apex predators decline, mesopredators often increase—a phenomenon called mesopredator release. If mesopredators become entrenched before apex predators can recover, they may competitively exclude the apex predators even after exploitation pressure is removed. The ecosystem has reorganized around the new dominant species.

Third, recovery pathways are not necessarily identical to pathways of decline. Hysteresis—where the route to recovery differs from the route to degradation—means that simply removing the original stressor may not be sufficient for recovery. The ecosystem may have crossed a threshold into an alternative state.

Habitat availability and connectivity also constrain recovery, particularly for terrestrial predators with large home ranges. Fragmented landscapes without wildlife corridors strongly inhibit recoveries.

We emphasized the importance of a social-ecological perspective. Apex predators evoke strong emotional responses—wonder and fear—and conflicts with human interests often intensify as predator populations rebuild. Successful predator recovery requires adaptive management sequences that embrace key environmental and species interactions as they emerge.

    content: `Ben Bolker, Craig Osenberg, and I tackled a problem that had been nagging at me since my dissertation work on coral reef fish predation. When predators reduce prey abundance, observed species richness declines. But is that because predators are selectively eliminating certain species, or simply because there are fewer individuals to sample? The difference matters: the first implies environmental filtering, the second is a statistical sampling artifact.

Beta diversity—how species composition varies among patches—faces this same confounding. Many ecological processes like immigration, predation, or nutrient limitation affect both abundance and the apparent differences among communities simultaneously. Existing metrics may confound changes in true beta diversity with changes that result from differences in sampling.

We developed a stochastic simulation model to explore how sampling affects beta diversity under different conditions. The results were striking and somewhat counterintuitive. Decreasing within-patch sample size generally increased observed beta diversity, but the relationship depended on the beta diversity metric used, the sample size, and the species abundance distribution. For presence-absence metrics like the Jaccard index, beta diversity curves could even have intermediate maxima when very rare species existed in the species pool.

We then developed a patch-level rarefaction technique to control for variation in within-patch sample size. The approach uses a rank-matching algorithm: rank patches by the number of individuals sampled, match patches by rank across treatments, and subsample all patches down to the minimum sample size in those ranks. This separates sampling effects from environmental filtering.

Power analysis showed the method worked well. For simulations with differing numbers of individuals but the same true beta diversity, the rarefied comparison correctly failed to reject the null hypothesis. When there was a true difference in asymptotic beta diversity, the method successfully detected it.

Two case studies from coral reef fish experiments illustrated the utility. In both experiments, predators reduced prey abundance. Raw beta diversity comparisons suggested predators changed community composition. But after rarefaction—asking whether communities still differed after accounting for the abundance effect—the apparent predator effects on beta diversity largely disappeared. The predators were generalists that reduced abundance equally across species, not selective agents reshaping community composition.

    content: `Austin Gallagher, Simon Brandl, and I combined field observations and laboratory experiments to test whether intraspecific variation in predator body size changes how mesopredators affect their prey. Body size is a fundamental factor governing predator-prey interactions—larger predators tend to have higher consumption rates, and prey perception of risk typically increases with predator size. Yet within-species size variation has rarely been investigated.

We focused on arc-eye hawkfish, a voracious ambush predator commonly found perched on branching corals in Moorea, French Polynesia. Hawkfish are territorial and solitary, with home ranges limited to about 5 meters, making them ideal for studying predator effects.

In field surveys along the back reef, we documented hawkfish presence and the co-occurrence of potential prey (chromis and damselfish) on coral heads. Hawkfish presence was negatively correlated with prey presence—coral heads with hawkfish were less likely to have prey fish. Critically, there was no difference between small and large hawkfish: both size classes had similar negative associations with prey occurrence.

Laboratory feeding experiments corroborated the field patterns. We measured attack rates of small (<4 cm) and large (>9 cm) hawkfish on chromis prey at varying densities. Attack rate estimates were statistically indistinguishable between size classes—small hawkfish attacked at 0.418 per individual per hour, large hawkfish at 0.243, with overlapping confidence intervals.

These findings suggest that the effects of small mesopredators on coral reefs can be size-independent. Even small hawkfish had substantial effects on recently recruited prey through both direct consumption and indirect fear effects. As humans continue altering marine food webs through size-selective harvesting, understanding how shifts in predator body size mediate ecosystem dynamics becomes increasingly important. Our results indicate that variation in predator size structure alone may not always change the functional role of mesopredators.

The motivation was clear: as climatic changes and human uses intensify, managers are taking actions to avoid or respond to ecosystem tipping points—dramatic shifts in structure and function that are often costly and hard to reverse. Evidence indicates that explicitly addressing tipping points leads to improved management outcomes. Yet most management frameworks assume linear responses.

Principle one: assume nonlinearity. A synthesis of empirical studies found that over half of 736 quantified stressor-response relationships in pelagic marine systems were nonlinear. When nonlinearities occur, they are often strongly nonlinear with detectable thresholds. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, managers should assume potential for threshold responses.

Principle two: address stressor intensity and interactive effects. Tipping points often require combinations of stressors to erode resilience—local anthropogenic stress combined with climate variability, or loss of top predators combined with nutrient enrichment. Understanding cross-scale interactions in both human and natural dimensions is critical.

Principle three: identify and monitor early-warning indicators. Theory predicts that loss of resilience produces characteristic changes before systems tip. Species richness may decline early, while indicators of dominant species show sudden drops just before shifts.

Principle four: make transparent the effects on stakeholders. Tipping points redistribute ecosystem benefits. Acknowledging this openly can build support for precautionary management and help communities adapt.

Principle five: increase precaution. Tipping points change the calculus of costs versus benefits. The costs of inaction rise sharply near thresholds, while the value of precise information increases.

Principle six: tie management targets to thresholds. Biologically informed targets that incorporate threshold dynamics are more likely to maintain ecosystem function than targets based on linear assumptions.

Principle seven: increase monitoring and intervention as risk grows. A tiered approach can reduce costs while managing risk—monitoring intensifies as indicators suggest increasing proximity to thresholds.

Early action to preserve system resilience is likely more practical, affordable, and effective than late action to halt or reverse a tipping point. By the time a threshold is crossed, it may be too late.

    content: `Seth Rudman, Mariano Rodriguez-Cabal, Takuya Sato, Julian Heavyside, Rana El-Sabaawi, Greg Crutsinger, and I combined insights from eco-evolutionary dynamics and community genetics to ask how genetic variation at multiple trophic levels interacts to shape ecosystems. Research in both fields has shown that genetic variation within species affects ecological processes, but studies have centered on individual focal species at single trophic levels.

We planted five genotypes of black cottonwood—a dominant riparian tree that shows local adaptation in productivity—around aquatic mesocosms. As leaves senesced in autumn, we collected litter from each tree and deposited it into the aquatic habitat. Cumulative leaf litter production varied over twofold among genotypes. In spring, we added either benthic or limnetic ecotypes of three-spined stickleback, or a no-fish control. These stickleback ecotypes have repeatedly evolved in lakes, with benthic forms feeding primarily in littoral areas on benthic invertebrates and limnetic forms feeding on zooplankton in open water.

The results revealed pervasive interactions between cottonwood genotype and stickleback ecotype. Four of the eight most common invertebrate taxa showed significant interactive effects. For example, oligochaete abundance depended on both the genotype of leaf litter and the ecotype of stickleback present. With less productive cottonwood genotypes, stickleback ecotype didn't matter much. But with the most productive genotypes, benthic stickleback increased oligochaete abundance while limnetic stickleback dramatically decreased it.

Soluble reactive phosphorus—the biologically available form of the most limiting nutrient in freshwater systems—also showed strong genotype-by-ecotype interactions. Tanks with benthic stickleback had higher phosphorus than those with limnetic stickleback, but the effect was strongest with the most productive cottonwood genotypes.

These findings fit ecological theory on the relationship between productivity and top-down control. Nutrient subsidies from leaf litter enhanced prey abundance, leading to stronger top-down effects. But our results extend this theory to show that intraspecific variation in productivity—not just total productivity—can drive these patterns. And intraspecific variation in predator phenotype further modified the relationship.

Critically, the effect sizes for the interaction between cottonwood genotype and stickleback ecotype were comparable to or larger than the effects of predator addition alone. Evolution at multiple trophic levels shapes ecosystems with effects as strong as classic ecological processes like predation.

    excerpt: "To understand mutualism, we must consider its community context—the other partners in the mutualism and non-mutualistic interactors in the community.

    content: `Todd Palmer, Elizabeth Pringle, Robert Holt, and I wrote this chapter to argue that much recent progress in understanding mutualism has come from carefully considering the broader communities in which mutualisms are embedded. The textbook view of mutualism as a stable partnership between two species misses how these relationships actually function in nature.

We opened with an apparent paradox from the highlands of East Africa. The ant Crematogaster nigriceps occupies Acacia drepanolobium trees, which pay heavily to support their ant occupants—channeling energy into extrafloral nectar and hollow domatia that house the ants. The ants sterilize the tree by destroying flower buds. They fail to defend against giraffe browsing. From the classic pairwise perspective, C. nigriceps appears to be a parasite. Yet long-term studies show the relationship is mutualistic, providing both growth and reproductive benefits to host trees.

The answer lies in community context. C. nigriceps is one of four ant species that compete for exclusive occupancy of trees. As a subordinate competitor, it tends to occupy young plants. For young trees, protection from elephants—which C. nigriceps provides effectively—matters more than reproducing. The rare but lethal elephant attack killed unprotected trees at much higher rates. Competitively superior, non-sterilizing ant species eventually supplant C. nigriceps as plants mature, releasing them from reproductive suppression. The ant that looked like a parasite was actually critical for tree survival during vulnerable early life stages.

We reviewed how complexity within mutualisms—the presence of multiple partner species on one or both sides of the interaction—affects outcomes. Partner diversity can increase fitness through functional complementarity or decrease it through competition among partners for resources provided by the other mutualist. Whether diversity helps or hurts depends on ecological context.

Mutualisms also feedback to modify community structure. Protection mutualisms can exclude predators, changing the composition of surrounding communities. Nutritional mutualisms can affect competitive outcomes among non-mutualist species. These feedbacks mean that mutualisms aren't just embedded in communities—they actively reshape them.

The chapter emphasizes that conservation of mutualistic relationships requires understanding their community context. Protecting pollinators and plants, corals and their symbionts, or any other mutualistic pair means protecting the ecological context that makes their partnership work.

    content: `Will White and I examined how predator density affects functional responses in coral reef fish. The functional response—the mathematical relationship between prey density and predation rate—is fundamental to understanding predator-prey dynamics. Most theoretical work develops from studies of single predators, but real reef communities contain multiple predators hunting simultaneously.

We investigated how predator density modifies these relationships. When predator densities change, per-capita predation rates don't remain constant. Multiple predators interact in ways that affect hunting efficiency—whether through interference, facilitation, or competition for prey.

The implications extend to how we model and predict reef fish dynamics. Standard approaches that assume constant per-capita predation rates may miss important density-dependent effects. As marine protected areas increase predator abundances and fishing reduces them elsewhere, understanding how predator density affects predation becomes practically important.

The work connects individual-level behavior to population-level dynamics. How predators interact with each other while hunting affects prey populations in ways that simple models don't capture. Incorporating these density-dependent functional responses into reef ecosystem models should improve predictions about how fish communities respond to changes in predator abundance.

    content: `Matthieu Leray and I investigated how predators affect the cryptofauna communities living within coral branches—the tiny fish, crabs, and shrimp that inhabit the protected spaces of coral architecture. Many of these small creatures aren't just tenants. Some are mutualists that provide documented benefits to their coral hosts, including defense against crown-of-thorns starfish and cleaning services.

We experimentally manipulated predator access to coral colonies in Moorea and tracked changes in cryptofauna communities. Predators significantly altered community organization. The effects weren't uniform across species—some groups were more vulnerable than others, and the composition of the cryptofauna community shifted in response to predation pressure.

Critically, mutualist species were affected by predation. These beneficial partners that provide services to corals were reduced when predators had access. This creates an indirect pathway through which predators can affect coral health—not by attacking corals directly, but by consuming the small creatures that would otherwise provide protective services.

The findings connect predation ecology to coral-mutualist interactions. Predators don't just affect their prey populations; they alter the web of beneficial relationships that help corals survive. As coral reefs face increasing stress from climate change and other threats, understanding all the factors that influence coral health—including these indirect effects through mutualist communities—becomes increasingly important for conservation and management.

    content: `Andrew Olaf Shelton, Jameal Samhouri, Phil Levin, and I developed models to navigate trade-offs between fisheries and ecosystem needs for Pacific herring, a species at the center of both commercial fisheries and marine food webs. Forage fish like herring, sardines, and anchovies occupy a precarious middle position—eaten by everything from whales to salmon to seabirds while also targeted by large industrial fisheries.

Pacific herring present a particularly interesting case because they support two distinct fisheries with different harvest targets. One fishery catches adult fish during spawning aggregations. Another harvests roe—the eggs that females deposit on kelp and other substrates—a traditional Indigenous fishery that supplies delicacy markets. We asked whether these two harvest strategies have equivalent effects on herring populations and their ecosystem.

Our age-structured models showed they do not. Herring populations can tolerate substantially higher rates of egg harvest than adult harvest before declining to risky levels. The asymmetry reflects life history: female herring produce enormous quantities of eggs, far more than could survive naturally. Most eggs die to predation, disease, or chance before becoming fish. Removing some eggs has marginal effect on recruitment because most would have died anyway. Remove an adult, though, and you remove all future spawning contributions from that individual.

This asymmetry isn't immediately intuitive—eggs seem more vulnerable than adults. But the math of surplus production tells a different story. The flexibility this creates for management has been underutilized.

We also tested whether ecosystem thresholds designed to protect herring predators would devastate fisheries. The answer surprised us: often not dramatically. For many scenarios, harvest levels that maintained herring populations above thresholds necessary for predator welfare weren't much lower than levels conventional single-species management would allow. The perceived trade-off between fishing and ecosystem protection was smaller than feared.

The critical insight is that the two fisheries must be assessed jointly. Treating egg harvest and adult harvest as independent management problems misses their interaction. Both draw from the same population, and sustainable levels for one depend on what's happening with the other. Ecosystem-based management of forage fish requires quantitative frameworks that track how fishing ripples through populations and up to predators—and that can distinguish between harvest strategies that look similar but have fundamentally different effects.

    content: `James Monaghan, François Michonneau, Matthew Smith, Bret Pasch, Malcolm Maden, Ashley Seifert, and I tested whether the axolotl's remarkable regenerative abilities are linked to its retention of larval features. Axolotls are obligate neotenes—they retain juvenile characteristics throughout life, never undergoing the metamorphosis that transforms other salamander larvae into terrestrial adults. They can also regenerate entire limbs, a capacity most amphibians lose during metamorphosis.

We induced metamorphosis by exposing axolotls to thyroid hormone, forcing them to undergo the transformation they normally avoid. We then compared limb regeneration between these induced metamorphs and normal neotenic axolotls.

The metamorphosed axolotls could still regenerate—the capacity wasn't completely lost. But regeneration was dramatically slower. Even more striking, the quality of regeneration suffered. Limbs regenerated by metamorphosed individuals showed more abnormalities, including missing bones, malformed skeletal elements, and other defects. The precision that characterizes axolotl regeneration was degraded.

We also examined gene expression in the regenerating tissue (blastema) and found differences between metamorphosed and neotenic animals. The molecular machinery of regeneration was altered by the metamorphic transition.

These findings suggest that metamorphosis doesn't just correlate with reduced regeneration—it may actively suppress regenerative capacity. The developmental programs that transform larvae into adults appear to down-regulate the cellular machinery that enables limb regrowth. Frogs show a similar pattern: tadpoles regenerate tails well, but this ability is lost around metamorphosis.

The axolotl's refusal to grow up may have preserved regenerative abilities that metamorphosis would have switched off. Evolution appears to have created a trade-off: growing up and growing back use developmental resources in ways that are difficult to combine.

For regenerative medicine, this has implications. If maturation actively suppresses regeneration—if growing up involves shutting down regenerative programs—then understanding those developmental switches might reveal targets for therapeutic intervention. The capacity to regenerate may not be absent in adult mammals but silenced by the same developmental processes that produce mature tissues.

    tags: ["Research","Methods","2014"],
    content: `Will White, Andrew Rassweiler, Jameal Samhouri, Crow White, and I addressed a methodological problem in ecological simulation modeling: the misuse of frequentist statistical hypothesis tests to interpret model results.

Statistical hypothesis testing was designed for situations where the null hypothesis might actually be true and sampling variation makes detection uncertain. In field experiments, treatments might have identical effects, and statistics quantify confidence that observed differences aren't just noise. Simulation models are different. If model parameters differ, running with different values will always produce different results. The null hypothesis is false by construction.

The problem is that statistical power in simulations is controlled by replication, which can be increased arbitrarily. Run enough model iterations and any difference—no matter how trivially small—achieves statistical significance. P < 0.05 just requires sufficient replicates. The ritual of hypothesis testing, designed to protect against false positives in noisy data, becomes meaningless when noise can be reduced at will.

We argued for focusing on effect sizes and practical significance rather than statistical significance when interpreting simulations. The question shouldn't be whether a model effect is detectable, but whether it's large enough to matter ecologically. This requires judgment about what magnitudes are meaningful, sensitivity analyses across parameter ranges, and clear communication about uncertainty. As simulation models become increasingly central to ecological forecasting and management, interpreting them correctly becomes essential.

    content: `Andrew Hein, Valeriano Parravicini, Michel Kulbicki, and I analyzed reef fish community data from across the Pacific Ocean to understand how trophic structure varies with island isolation. The standard expectation is that remote islands should lose top predators first—predators need prey to sustain them, and isolation should make predator colonization difficult.

The data showed a different pattern. While total species richness declined with isolation as expected, prey species declined faster than predators. Remote islands had higher ratios of predator species to prey species than near-shore reefs. The most isolated atolls had proportionally more predators, not fewer.

The explanation comes from larval biology. Reef fish larvae drift in ocean currents before settling onto reefs, and different species have different larval durations. Predatory fish tend to have longer larval periods, allowing them to disperse farther. Prey species have shorter larval periods and settle closer to their origins. Distance filters species differentially by trophic group.

We developed a colonization-extinction model incorporating these dispersal differences. The model predicted that predator-to-prey ratios should increase with isolation, matching the observed pattern. Larval dispersal biology at the individual level scales up to determine food web structure across ocean basins. This has implications for how we think about remote reef conservation—the ecological constraints on isolated reefs may differ fundamentally from near-shore systems.

Trophic island biogeography theory predicts that predator effects should depend on habitat structure—specifically, that predators should have stronger effects in larger, more connected patches.

We designed a factorial experiment manipulating both predator presence and habitat characteristics across coral patches in Moorea. Both factors significantly affected fish community organization. Predators reduced prey diversity. Larger habitat patches supported more species.

The surprising result was what didn't happen. The two factors acted largely independently. Predator effects were similar regardless of patch size or connectivity. The interaction predicted by theory was weak or absent. Small isolated patches weren't predator refuges, and large connected patches didn't show amplified predator effects.

This disconnect between theory and data raises questions about whether trophic island biogeography—developed largely from terrestrial systems—applies straightforwardly to coral reefs. Marine environments may operate under different rules, with fish mobility and coral structural complexity creating dynamics that don't match terrestrial predictions. The conservation implications depend on understanding why the expected pattern didn't emerge.

    content: `Joshua Idjadi, Shane Geange, Jada-Simone White, and I documented an exceptional settlement event for convict surgeonfish in Moorea—the largest anyone at the research station had seen. Surgeonfish carpeted the reef in densities far beyond normal, suggesting this cohort might dominate fish communities for years.

Within weeks, most were dead. We tracked mortality as the massive settlement event collapsed. Predators picked off settlers at high rates—so many vulnerable fish concentrated in one place made hunting efficient. Competition for food intensified as settlers stripped algae from the reef surface. Fish crowded into hiding spots meant for fewer individuals. The mathematics of too many fish competing for too little space took its toll.

By the time the mortality wave passed, the exceptional settlement had produced roughly average recruitment to the population. The surplus had vanished through density-dependent mortality.

This demonstrates how density dependence acts as a buffer. When settlers arrive at typical densities, per-capita survival is reasonable. When densities soar, resources become limiting, predators concentrate their efforts, and per-capita survival plummets. The population mechanism erases exceptional inputs through exceptional mortality.

The implications matter for reef fish population management. Simple models suggest more larvae arriving should mean more adults growing up. But if density-dependent mortality compensates strongly, extra recruits just die at higher rates. The population ceiling may be set by carrying capacity rather than larval supply. Enhancing larval production may produce diminishing returns if the reef cannot support the additional fish.

    content: `Shane Geange, Kate Hanson, Ben Bolker, and I investigated how both predator density and timing of arrival affect reef fish prey communities. Standard predation experiments compare treatments with and without predators, but predators in nature vary not just in presence but in when they appear.

We designed an experiment manipulating both factors. Hawkfish arrived at coral patches early—when prey fish were settling from the plankton—or late, after prey were established. Results showed timing matters as much as density, maybe more.

Early-arriving hawkfish had disproportionately strong effects on prey communities. They could pick off new settlers before prey had time to grow, learn the reef, or develop avoidance behaviors. Late-arriving predators, even at higher densities, encountered prey that were larger, more experienced, and better able to escape. A single early predator shaped prey communities more powerfully than multiple late predators.

The difference reflects a temporal refuge. Prey that survived early predation had already passed through their most vulnerable window. Prey facing late predation had the advantage of size and experience. This temporal dimension creates dynamics that density alone doesn't capture.

This finding has implications for how climate change may affect reef communities. Warming is shifting the timing of biological events—when larvae settle, when predators arrive. If these shifts differ between predators and prey, historical timing relationships dissolve. A predator that always arrived after prey settlement might start arriving before, fundamentally changing the interaction. Predicting these changes requires experiments that treat timing as a variable, not a constant.

    content: `Shane Geange, Jeff Shima, and I documented competitive hierarchies among juvenile damselfish on coral heads in Moorea. When larval fish settle from the plankton onto coral habitat, they immediately enter competition for limited space. Despite their similar sizes, species sort into consistent dominance relationships.

Through systematic behavioral observations, we documented who wins confrontations, who backs down, and how dominance translates into position on the coral. The outcomes were consistent—certain species dominated while others lost. The hierarchy formed rapidly, within hours of arrival.

The positioning consequences were ecologically meaningful. Coral heads offer heterogeneous habitat—some spots are deep within the protective matrix of branches, others are exposed on the periphery. Dominant species claimed the safest microhabitats while subordinates were relegated to exposed positions. Peripheral positions mean higher predation risk, suggesting that losing competitive interactions translates into higher mortality.

This phase of reef fish life history is often overlooked. Most research focuses on adults—their abundance, behavior, and population dynamics—or on larval supply. But between arrival on the reef and adulthood lies a period where tiny fish must find food, avoid predators, and compete with rivals. The outcomes of these juvenile competitive interactions may determine which individuals and species dominate adult communities.

As coral degradation reduces habitat availability, competition among recruits may intensify as fish crowd onto surviving coral patches. Climate change is also altering species arrival timing and composition, potentially reshuffling historical competitive relationships. The outcomes of these tiny battles will influence which fish populations persist.

    content: `Lindsey Carr, Katharina Fietz, Ignacio Montero, Austin Gallagher, John Bruno, and I documented evidence of ongoing illegal shark fishing within the Galápagos Marine Reserve. The reserve enjoys every designation conservationists can bestow: UNESCO World Heritage Site, shark sanctuary, one of the largest marine protected areas in the world. Despite these protections, shark poaching continues.

We compiled records of interceptions, cataloged confiscated catch, and combined these with observations during fieldwork. The evidence showed boats entering the reserve with illegal longlines, sharks with fins removed, and enforcement officers intercepting poachers. The activity wasn't isolated incidents—it was ongoing.

The gap between designation and reality represents a fundamental challenge in marine conservation. Establishing a reserve requires political will and lines on a map. Actually protecting it requires patrol boats, enforcement officers, legal systems that prosecute violators, and sustained funding for all of the above. The Galápagos is famous and relatively well-funded by marine reserve standards, yet still cannot prevent poaching. The ocean is too vast and enforcement too expensive, while economic incentives for poaching remain strong. Shark fins command high prices in international markets.

International conservation accounting tracks the percentage of ocean under protection and celebrates when these numbers increase. But a square kilometer of 'protected' water where enforcement is absent contributes nothing to conservation goals. The sharks don't know they're legally protected. They only know who's trying to catch them.

The Galápagos hosts important shark aggregations—hammerheads, Galápagos sharks, whale sharks—that are both ecologically significant and attractive targets for poachers. Sharks reproduce slowly and can withstand only minimal fishing pressure before populations decline. If poaching continues even in one of the world's most protected marine areas, the broader challenge of shark conservation becomes clear.

    content: `Michael Gil, Seabird McKeon, Sarah Lemer, Matthieu Leray, Suzanne Mills, Craig Osenberg, and I investigated housekeeping services provided by coral symbionts. Guard crabs and snapping shrimp are known for defending corals, but they spend most of their time moving around coral surfaces, grooming tissue. We tested whether this activity constitutes meaningful sediment removal.

We surveyed coral colonies across Moorea to document symbiont communities. Crabs and shrimp co-occurred more often than chance would predict, suggesting they weren't excluding each other through competition. In experiments, we placed corals with varying numbers of symbionts and measured sediment removal. Corals alone cleared limited sediment from their surfaces. Adding symbionts substantially increased removal rates.

The effects added up independently. Each symbiont contributed roughly equal cleaning regardless of how many others were present—no interference at higher densities, but no synergy either. Housekeeping appears to be parallel labor: each symbiont clears sediment from its vicinity without coordinating with others.

This additive pattern means losing symbionts causes proportional losses in cleaning services. Sedimentation threatens reefs from coastal development, dredging, and erosion. Corals have limited self-cleaning ability—their survival depends on the cleaning crew living within their branches. Protecting corals means protecting the crabs and shrimp that keep them clean.

    content: `Ashley Seifert, James Monaghan, Matthew Smith, Bret Pasch, François Michonneau, Malcolm Maden, and I reviewed what determines whether animals can regenerate appendages. Salamanders regrow limbs. Starfish regrow arms. Many other animals seal wounds with scar tissue and function with missing parts. We examined what regenerators have in common that non-regenerators lack.

Patterns emerged from comparative analysis. Regenerators tend to be smaller with lower metabolic rates. They often retain developmental characteristics into adulthood—cellular plasticity that enables rebuilding lost structures. The source of regenerative cells varies: some species dedifferentiate mature cells back to stem-like states, while others tap resident stem cell populations.

The correlations suggest trade-offs. The high metabolism that lets mammals maintain warm bodies may come at the cost of cellular plasticity. Complex immune systems that protect against infection may interfere with regenerative processes. Growing large and developing quickly may preclude maintaining the flexibility regeneration requires.

For regenerative medicine, this means simply finding a 'regeneration gene' and adding it may not work. The constraints may reflect fundamental trade-offs with other systems we need. But if constraints are modulable—if we can temporarily restore plasticity or create favorable conditions locally—enhancement becomes conceivable. Understanding the full package of traits that enable regeneration is the first step toward mimicking it.

    content: `Seabird McKeon, Shelby McIlroy, Ben Bolker, and I investigated whether multiple mutualist species defending corals provide synergistic protection. Guard crabs and snapping shrimp both defend their coral hosts from predators like crown-of-thorns starfish. The question was whether their combined effects exceed, match, or fall short of what their individual effects would predict.

We designed experiments testing coral defense with crabs alone, shrimp alone, both together, and neither. When crown-of-thorns starfish threatened corals, both mutualists provided protection individually. But the combined effect was synergistic—corals with both defenders lost substantially less tissue than predictions based on independent effects would suggest.

The synergy suggests complementary defense strategies. Guard crabs patrol outer coral branches, physically confronting predators. Snapping shrimp work from deeper within the coral matrix, their stunning snaps providing a different form of deterrence. Together, they create layered defense that's harder for predators to overcome than either alone.

This 'multiple defender effect' mirrors the concept of multiple predator effects—where predators hunting together can show emergent effects on prey. We're seeing the reverse: defenders working together show emergent effects on protection. The implication for coral conservation is that mutualist diversity matters. A coral hosting only crabs loses the synergistic benefit that crabs plus shrimp provide. As reef degradation reduces mutualist communities, corals lose disproportionate protection.

    content: `Mike McCoy, Craig Osenberg, and I identified a systematic bias in how ecologists detect emergent multiple predator effects—the non-additive consequences of multiple predators hunting together. Sometimes predators coordinate and kill more prey than expected from their individual effects (risk enhancement). Sometimes they interfere and kill fewer (risk reduction). The standard methods for detecting these effects are flawed.

The problem is that standard approaches assume predators kill prey at a constant rate regardless of how many prey remain. In reality, predation rates change as prey get depleted—predators exhibit functional responses. Experiments run over time as prey are consumed. The statistical comparison between observed mortality and predictions based on individual predator effects isn't comparing like to like when the prediction ignores how depletion affects killing rates.

The bias isn't random. For additive designs—where predators are added together—the bias inflates apparent risk enhancement. For substitutive designs—where total predator density stays constant but composition changes—the bias inflates apparent risk reduction. Published literature contains spurious conclusions in both directions.

We developed corrected methods that account for functional responses and prey depletion. When applied to published data, conclusions changed. Effects that appeared significant dissolved while other patterns emerged more clearly. The corrected understanding of multiple predator effects differs substantially from conventional wisdom.

This represents a sobering case study in methodology. Decades of research used a flawed analytical framework, not from carelessness but because the bias is subtle. Recognizing it required carefully working through the mathematics. Understanding how predator diversity affects prey requires getting the analytical tools right.

    content: `Andrew Shantz, Joshua Idjadi, and I tested how coral density and predation affect coral growth. Standard ecological theory predicts that organisms living close together compete for resources, so corals planted close together should grow slower. We found the opposite: corals with neighbors grew faster than isolated corals.

The experiment manipulated two factors: predator access and neighbor density. Caging corals to exclude predatory fish boosted growth, confirming that corallivory takes a toll. But the density effect was larger and opposite to predictions. More neighbors meant more growth, not less.

The mechanism remains unclear. Clustered coral colonies might alter water flow beneficially, enhancing delivery of food particles or export of waste. They might attract more mutualist partners than isolated colonies can support. Neighbors might reduce sedimentation through collective effects on currents.

The finding has implications for coral restoration. Projects typically space transplants widely to minimize expected competition. But if spacing sacrifices density benefits that natural reefs provide, this approach might be undermining restoration success. Strategic clustering—close enough for facilitation without intense competition—might accelerate recovery. Understanding reefs as integrated systems rather than collections of competing individuals could improve conservation strategies.

Salt marshes, mangroves, seagrass beds, coral reefs, shellfish reefs, and beaches all provide services that benefit human welfare—storm protection, fishery nurseries, carbon storage, water filtration, tourism support.

We reviewed how these services are valued economically. Storm protection can be quantified by comparing damage scenarios with and without ecosystem buffers. Fishery nursery value derives from tracing commercial catch to juvenile habitats. Carbon storage connects to emerging carbon markets. The methods have become sophisticated, though estimates still carry substantial uncertainty.

The values are large. Individual hectares of coastal habitat can generate substantial annual value, primarily through services that traditional economics treats as free. When developers convert coastal ecosystems, these values disappear but rarely appear in cost-benefit analyses. The marsh being filled generated services—storm protection, fishery support, water filtration—but nobody was billing for them.

Quantifying ecosystem services doesn't guarantee conservation, but it makes explicit what's lost when ecosystems are destroyed. Uncertainty doesn't justify assigning zero value—zero is almost certainly wrong. Coastal ecosystems sustain economies that depend on them but rarely acknowledge the debt. Making that debt visible is the first step toward sustainable management.

Studies seemed to contradict each other—some showed competition driving density dependence, others showed predation, others showed habitat limitation. The resolution was scale.

At small scales—individual coral heads or patch reefs—behavioral mechanisms dominate. Crowded fish compete intensely, fight frequently, and venture into dangerous areas where predators catch them. At larger scales—reef sections and lagoons—habitat configuration and dispersal processes take over. Total habitat area limits populations, and fish redistribute across the landscape.

Neither perspective is wrong. They're measuring different things at different resolutions. A patch-scale experiment captures individual behavioral responses. A reef-scale study captures landscape-level dynamics. The apparent contradictions in the literature reflect different views of the same system.

This matters for management. Marine reserves and fishing regulations operate at particular scales. Matching predictions about density dependence to the appropriate spatial scale determines whether management interventions will work as expected.

We set up a factorial experiment on Pocillopora colonies, manipulating both guard crab presence and vermetid presence. Vermetids reduced coral growth, confirming their negative effects. But corals with both vermetids and guard crabs grew better than corals with vermetids alone—the crabs were somehow offsetting the snail damage.

The mechanism isn't certain. Guard crabs might physically dislodge mucus nets during their constant movement. They might create water currents that wash settling mucus away. Their territorial behavior might incidentally harass vermetids. Whatever the process, the functional outcome was clear.

Guard crabs aren't single-purpose defenders. They provide multiple services whose value compounds across threat types. A coral losing its guard crabs loses protection from starfish and from vermetid damage. As reefs degrade and crab populations decline, remaining corals face mounting threats without their multi-service mutualist partners.

    content: `Craig Osenberg and I investigated what happens when you add reef habitat. The simple expectation is proportional response: more habitat, more fish. But settlement didn't scale linearly with habitat availability. Instead, adding habitat redistributed the larvae that were already arriving.

We called this propagule redirection. Larvae drifting toward the reef settle on whatever habitat they encounter. With more patches available, the same larvae spread across more reef. Isolated patches received more settlers than patches with neighbors nearby—alternative habitat diluted settlement at any single location.

This sounds like bad news—just shuffling fish around. But redirection had consequences. Lower settlement density meant weaker competition and less aggression. Fish on less-crowded patches survived better. Total recruitment after density-dependent mortality played out was higher when more habitat was available—not because more larvae arrived, but because more survived.

The practical implications affect restoration design. Adding habitat helps, but through mechanisms different than usually assumed. Strategic placement that effectively spreads settlement and reduces crowding could outperform approaches that simply maximize habitat area.

We ran an experiment removing vermetids from some colonies while leaving them on others. Corals freed from vermetids grew faster and survived better. What appeared to be a neutral association was actually parasitism.

The mechanism is likely the mucus nets vermetids cast to trap food particles. These sticky nets settle on coral tissue, potentially smothering polyps, blocking light needed for photosynthesis, and creating conditions for pathogen growth. Individual effects are subtle, but vermetids are often abundant—multiple individuals per colony—and effects compound over time.

Vermetids won't make headlines like bleaching events or crown-of-thorns outbreaks. But they're another chronic stressor on corals already facing mounting pressures. On high-value colonies targeted for restoration or genetic preservation, vermetid removal might boost coral performance. Recognizing the threat was the first step.

Predators dramatically reduced recruit abundance on exposed patches. Species richness also dropped. The question was whether predators were filtering the community—preferentially consuming certain species—or just reducing everyone proportionally.

Rarefaction analysis provided the answer. When we standardized for total abundance, community composition was similar between caged and exposed patches. Predators weren't selecting certain species; they were eating prey in proportion to their availability. The species that became rare under predation were the same species that were rare without predation. Common species stayed relatively common.

This non-selective pattern means predators affect community size without reshaping community structure. If predator effects operate through total mortality rather than selective filtering, then managing diversity requires managing overall predation pressure rather than protecting specific vulnerable species—because all species are equally vulnerable.

    content: `Shane Geange and I documented a trophic cascade linking nudibranchs to cyanobacterial blooms through intermediate effects on sea hares. The chain works through predator-grazer-producer dynamics: Lyngbya cyanobacteria produce toxins that most grazers avoid, but sea hares consume Lyngbya despite its toxicity. Nudibranchs prey on sea hares.

In laboratory trials, nudibranchs consumed sea hares at substantial rates, with smaller sea hares being particularly vulnerable. When nudibranchs were present, cyanobacterial biomass increased—not because nudibranchs eat cyanobacteria (they don't), but because they reduce the sea hare populations that would otherwise graze the cyanobacteria.

This trophic cascade connects predators to primary producers through intermediate effects on herbivores—the same dynamic that links wolves to willows through elk, or sea otters to kelp through urchins. Cyanobacterial blooms are increasing on degraded reefs worldwide. Standard management focuses on nutrient reduction and coral restoration. Our findings suggest food web structure—including populations of small predators like nudibranchs—also influences bloom dynamics.

    content: `Shane Geange and I tested how priority effects and habitat complexity affect competitive outcomes among settling reef fish. We manipulated both factors: some fish arrived simultaneously with competitors while others arrived late, and reefs varied in structural complexity.

Late arrivers suffered substantially higher mortality. Early residents had established territories, learned the terrain, and grown larger. They attacked newcomers relentlessly, driving mortality rates that far exceeded those of fish arriving simultaneously.

We expected complex habitat might buffer late arrivers by providing hiding places. It didn't work that way. Complex habitat improved survival for early and simultaneous arrivers, but late arrivers died at high rates regardless of habitat complexity. Residents knew where all the hiding spots were and searched them systematically.

The first-mover advantage created by even short priority periods was substantial. Climate change is altering when larvae spawn, develop, and settle. If different species shift their timing differently, historical competitive relationships may dissolve. Species that historically arrived simultaneously might find themselves systematically late—facing resident aggression they never evolved to handle.

    content: `Shane Geange and I tested how arrival order affects competitive outcomes between wrasse species. We varied when fish arrived at patch reefs—simultaneously with competitors, or days earlier or later.

Both species survived best alone. When competitors were present, simultaneous arrival was next best—neither species had priority advantage. But when one species arrived first, outcomes diverged sharply. Early arrivers survived well. Late arrivers faced intense aggression and died at much higher rates.

Residents became increasingly hostile as their residency lengthened. A fish that had occupied the reef for several days attacked newcomers constantly, chasing them from feeding sites and preventing territory establishment. The aggression emerged from priority alone—being there first and defending that advantage.

Climate change is altering when larvae spawn, develop, and settle. If different species shift their timing differently, historical competitive relationships may dissolve. Species that historically arrived together might become systematically late relative to competitors—facing resident aggression they never evolved to handle.

    content: `Sarah Boyer, Jamison White, Craig Osenberg, and I tested whether clove oil—a standard fish anesthetic—affects corals. Clove oil quickly sedates fish and wears off without apparent harm, making it a standard research tool. But we were applying it near corals, and nobody had tested whether the compound affected non-target organisms.

We exposed corals to a range of clove oil concentrations. The dose-response was clear: higher concentrations caused more bleaching and slower growth. The active ingredient eugenol doesn't discriminate between targets—what sedates fish nervous systems can disrupt coral cellular processes.

Using ethanol as a solvent made effects worse. Many protocols dissolve clove oil in ethanol to help dispersion, but this amplified the damage.

We're not arguing researchers should stop using clove oil—it remains among the safer fish anesthetics available. But concentration matters. Using minimum effective doses, applying anesthetic away from coral colonies when possible, and recognizing that field techniques affect non-target organisms can help minimize unintended impacts. For reefs already stressed by warming and acidification, additional stress from research activities represents an irony worth minimizing.

    content: `Mark Steele, Andrew Brooks, and I documented reef fish using crown-of-thorns starfish as habitat. While surveying starfish in Moorea, we repeatedly observed small fish sheltering among the venomous spines. The creature famous for destroying coral habitat was serving as habitat itself.

Crown-of-thorns seastars devastate reefs—their outbreaks leave bleached coral skeletons across the Pacific. Yet small juvenile fish were darting in and out of the deadly spines like they'd found a mobile shelter. The irony compounds: as the starfish eats coral and destroys fish habitat, it becomes temporary replacement habitat. The venomous spines that make crown-of-thorns dangerous provide a defensive barrier that tiny fish exploit.

Small juveniles dominated the fish we documented associating with starfish—exactly the size class most vulnerable to predation in open water. They stayed among the spines rather than fleeing across open substrate when approached.

Ecological reality resists tidy narratives of villains and victims. The destroyer also provides services. This matters less for practical management—nobody will cultivate crown-of-thorns as fish habitat—than for understanding that reef ecosystems involve complexity that defies simple stories.
